title: What is Mamba

If you use `conda`, you should use `mamba`. What is `mamba` then? The website describes it as:

> A Python-based CLI conceived as a drop-in replacement for conda, offering higher speed and more reliable environment solutions

So you install `mamba` into your `conda` environment and for certain commands where you would
use `conda` you use `mamba` instead. The parameters are effectively the same.

So when you want to **Create an enviroment:**

```bash
conda create  -n myenv -c bioconda samtools
# becomes
mamba create -n myenv  -c bioconda  samtools
```

**Install software:**

```bash
conda install bqplot
# becomes
mamba install bqplot
```

**Remove software:**

```bash
conda remove bqplot
# becomes
mamba remove bqplot
```

As you can see, it's pretty much substitute `conda` for `mamba`. The outcome is
exactly the same, except the install time is **much** faster.

I usually keep seperate enviroments for each project, so I first create the
enviroment with `conda` with `mamba` installed and then I switch to using mamba
like the examples above. e.g.

```bash
conda create  -n myenv mamba
conda activate myenv
mamba install prokka
```
