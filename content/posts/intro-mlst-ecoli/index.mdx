Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) is a molecular typing method used to characterize bacterial strains, including _E. coli_. It involves sequencing multiple housekeeping genes and assigning unique allele numbers to variations in these genes. By comparing the allelic profiles, known as sequence types (STs), it becomes possible to infer the genetic relatedness and population structure of _E. coli_ isolates. MLST has been instrumental in understanding the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, and evolution of _E. coli_ strains, aiding in outbreak investigations and surveillance efforts. It provides a standardized and reproducible approach for comparing and sharing data across laboratories and has been widely adopted in _E. coli_ research. There are at least three MLST schemes for E. coli, from [Wirth et al](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05172.x), [Jaureguy et al](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-9-560) and [Qi et al](http://shigatox.net/ecmlst/cgi-bin/index). The designations commonly encountered like ST131 or ST95 or ST10 are defined in the [Wirth et al](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05172.x) scheme.

Below is a reading list of key publications to help understand MLST (in general) and how it applies to _E. coli_. A BibTex file cataloguing of all the publications below is [available here](/bibtex/ecolimlst.bib). The short summaries of each paper were generated by ChatGPT4.
