You see an error message like this:
```

```

This tells you there is **not enough space for Singularity to build your container**.

### What can you do?
You can disable the Singularity cache, or get it to write somewhere else. There are two variables to play with:

* SINGULARITY_DISABLE_CACHE If you want to disable the cache, this means is that the layers are written to a temporary directory. Thus, if you want to disable cache and write to a temporary folder, simply set SINGULARITY_DISABLE_CACHE to any true/yes value. By default, the cache is not disabled.
* SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR Is the base folder for caching layers and singularity hub images. If not defined, it uses default of $HOME/.singularity. If defined, the defined location is used instead.

Either of these could help avoid writing docker layers to /root/.singularity/docker.
