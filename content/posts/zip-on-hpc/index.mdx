The problem is to find all fastq files, and submit each one, one by one as a job to be gzipped.

### Local machine
```
ls *.fastq | xargs -I {} gzip {}
```

**Multicore version** 

You will need to have `pigz` installed. 

```
ls *.fastq | xargs -I {} pigz {}
```

### Compute cluster - HPC
This really applies if you are working on a computing cluster (SLURM). 

```
ls *.fastq | xargs -I {} sbatch --wrap="gzip {}"
```

**Multicore version** 

You will need to have `pigz` installed. 

```
ls *.fastq | xargs -I {} sbatch --wrap="pigz {}"
```
