This really applies if you are working on a computing cluster (SLURM). 
The problem is to find all fastq files, and submit each one, one by one as a job to be gzipped.

```
ls *.fastq | xargs -I {} sbatch --wrap="gzip {}"
```

Do you have a better idea? At me on Twitter. [@happy_khan](https://twitter.com/happy_khan)
