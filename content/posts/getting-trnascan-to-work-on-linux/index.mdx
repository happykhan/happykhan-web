title: Getting tRNAscan to work on Linux

A friend/collaborator was having problems getting
[tRNAscan-SE](http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/) to work on his
Debian machine (I think it was Debian). We came up with a fix for it
that I'd like to share.

tRNAScan-SE predicts transfer RNA genes in a nucleotide sequence. It was
written by Todd Lowe & Sean Eddy ([The
paper](http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/5/0955)) and it's very,
very good at what it does but there is a glitch with compiling it on my
Fedora 14 installation & my buddy's Debian machine. This is what happens
when we try to compile it:

```bash
[nabil@tinkerbell tRNAscan-SE-1.3]$ make gcc -O -c trnascan.c gcc -O
-DTSCANDIR=/home/nabil/lib/tRNAscan-SE -o trnascan-1.4 trnascan.c gcc
-O -c align.c
.... blah blah blah blah blah....
scorestack.c: In function 'free_hitstack': scorestack.c:247:54:
warning: comparison between pointer and integer
gcc -O -c sqio.c sqio.c:238:1:
error: conflicting types for 'getline' /usr/include/stdio.h:673:20:
note: previous declaration of 'getline' was here
make: *** [sqio.o] Error 1``
```

So, apparently on some linux distros, 'getline' function is an
environment variable and creates a conflict during tRNAscan-SE
installation. (This is basically what's written in the compile error).

**BUT to fix this problem, run this command in the tRNAscan-SE
directory**:

```bash
perl -pi -e "s/getline/getline2/g" sqio.c
```

This command will change all getline variables on the file sqio.c to
getline2, avoiding conflicts.

**Problem solved\!**
