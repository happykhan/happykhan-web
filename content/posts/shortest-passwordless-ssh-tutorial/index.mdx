I've used this thrice in three days, so I'm just keeping a copy for
myself.

Sourced (i.e. blatant copy-paste) from:
<http://arbib.it/tag/shortest-passwordless-ssh-tutorial/>

That in turn got it from
<http://blogs.translucentcode.org/mick/archives/000230.html>

**Begin:**

```bash
local$ ssh-keygen -t dsa
local$ scp ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub remote:~/
local$ ssh username@remote
remote$ cat ~/id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
remote$ chmod 644 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
remote$ exit
local$ ssh username@remote
```

Now instead of the normal password you should be asked for the password
you entered for your dsa key. This isn't passwordless yet but shows that
ssh is using the key.

Note: Leave Key password blank to have passwordless authentication

Fixes for possible problems:

```bash
chmod 0600
authorized_keys
ln -s authorized_keys2 authorized_keys (or viceversa)
```
