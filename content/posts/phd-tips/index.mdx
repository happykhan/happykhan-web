# Advice for PHD students and tips for the rest of us 

When I was a doctoral student, I actively asked anyone I
could for advice about academia and being a scientist. It
has been seven years since my doctorate was awarded and
thinking back, these were the five single most useful
quotable pieces of advice I received. These were either
advice given directly given to me by my professors, or
recounted by fellow students. Many of these topics are very
complex. I will  touch on them only briefly here. 

These are not the most important things I learnt  - but
those cannot be distilled into a single quote. Hopefully,
these single statements will help you. 

### Keep firm boundaries 
> You’re here from 9 to 5 and if you’re not in the lab
you should be reading papers.

This was a relayed to a friend on their first day. This was
said to them as a hard reminder that a PhD candidature
should be treated like a job - where there are contracted
hours of work. I believe such boundaries are important to
understand if you are overworking yourself and neglecting
other parts of life. If you follow the nine-to-five advice
above and make it clear to your team that is how you work,
then no one (especially you) can say that you have not
applied the effort. During the work period, you can focus
on the tasks at hand. In your off-period, you can attend to
other matters and relax guilt free. 

The exact timings may be different for different people and
will change over the course of a candidature. Have a
regular dialogue about working habits and timings with your
advisory team. Be deliberate with your working hours.
Manage expectations of when work will be completed, given
those timings. Sure, you can work after hours for the final
push of a manuscript or a set of experiments, but if this
workload is very demanding, then consider how to balance
this later. Perhaps you work Sunday morning, so you can
have a later start on Monday. Or perhaps you work hard for
a few weeks, so schedule easier work (or adjust deadlines)
for the week after so you can recover. 

### Remember  why you do what you do
>The P in PHD means Phillosphy, so philosophize. 

PhDs start with a single broad question. As we delve deeper
into a PhD, we become more focused on details that serve
answering the broader topic rather than directly working on
the question itself. This is necessary to perform tractable
experiments with the project’s time frame. PhD candidates
can spend a lot of time learning all the different
techniques to collect data, which are the best for a
situation and how to optimise different methods in our
research. We usually apply these methods to one specific
facet, which is supposed to act as proxy for the question
at large.

But this leads to a common trap when a candidate writes
their dissertation. They frame their thesis - the singular
idea present in their work - with a narrow view that fits
within their day-to-day experience. Having looked so
closely at the matter for so long they cannot step back and
contextualise their project in the scope of the original,
lofty research question. 

Remember, work exists in a wider dialogue about a science and
in the philosophy of a discipline. It is in this on which to
ruminate in the dissertation. It is important to talk to
other people outside your immediate peers and try to
explain your project so that you maintain the
perspective. 

### Simplify  your message
> In a 15 minutes talk, present just one interesting
idea

A professor once explained to us how to structure a
scientific talk. Most talks are around 10-15 minutes. He
told us flatly that this is not a lot of time to explain an
entire project. His approach for a presentation was to pick
a single exciting and new result (presented as a figure on
one slide) and then spend the rest of the slides and time
explaining that figure. 

It is easiest to frame your result as “if this then that”
or “in this group we see this and in that group we see that
because of something else”. Cause and effect. Or compare
and contrast. This is much easier for an outsider to
understand because, while they might not understand the
nuance, they can appreciate that something is changing and
there is a reason for it. 
If your result is “Upregulation of gene X in species Y
causes phenotype Z”. You would have One (or two) slides
showing this result directly. But in presenting those two
slides alone, the audience has no context. You must
contexualise it by explaining the following::

* Introductuon: What is species Y? 
* Introduction: What is gene X?
* Introduction: What is the phenotype?  
* Introduction: Why is this important? 
* Introduction: How does this fit with our wider
understand? (You may couch this in wider context of your
PhD project or the field generally)
* Aims: This isn't a question but you may want a slide to
sum all the motivations for the work (i.e. state your aims)
* Methods: How did you achieve this result? What was the
method (briefly)? 
* **The result**
* Discussion and conclusion: What are the limitations or
caveats to the results and methods? 
* Discussion and conclusion: What's the implication to what
we know already and what are the next steps?

Answers for each of these questions could each be a slide.
And these answers, with the result itself, will fill your
time. 

Anything that does not directly relate understanding the
figure can be cut, and usually has to be cut, to make the
time limit. The worst thing you can do in a presentation is
go over time. 

### Make time your ally
> Have you tried time management methods (like
Pomodoro)? I finished off three manuscripts in three
months.

One of my professors pointed out the value of time
management. These days, there are infinite distractions
with people and busy work vying for our attention. I feel
time management is crucial in a PhD candidature, where you
are often left to manage the day-to-day of the project. You
are, in effect, a project manager. And there are techniques
from project management that you can use to help. I want to
mention Pomodoro as one of those techniques of being able
to focus on a task and just get it done. 

Pomodoro is a specific time management system, where it
breaks work hours into two-hour blocks where you work
solely on a single task for 25 minutes (no interruptions
allowed), then break for five minutes. You can opt to
continue that task or switch to something else. At the end
of two hours, you take a longer break and repeat the
process. This not only keeps you focused, but having the
breaks embedded allow your to give yourself a rest so that
you can sustain working for longer. There is a larger
philosophy to the system. For instance, you can use the
number of Pomodoros to complete a task to schedule how long
it can take, then adjust deadlines according. Over time you
can review the amount of work you have done and review
where your time is being spent. And when you feel you have
not done enough work in a week, you can look at your
Pomodoros and know that is not true. 

I find it works well for writing and administrative tasks,
but not so much when you are a deep thought like
programming or deep writing. Those tasks require a certain
momentum (casually I would say that you need to be “in the
zone”) that the Pomodoro timings disrupts. 

Time management is an entire field of study with many other
techniques. The field of study is well worth exploring. 

### Perfection  is the enemy of good

> Have you heard the 90/10 rule? 90% of the work gets done
in 10% of the time and that last 10% of the work takes 90%
of the time. 

I once attending a talk from a professor, giving career advice to our student cohort.
As a self-proclaimed perfectionist, he explained he had come to
accept the “90/10 rule” with reluctance. This realisation came 
early in his career as he was engaged in a number of different 
concurrent projects. The 90/10 rule basically
posits that the time to elevate something good to excellent
can be an onerous task. We do not have infinite time to
spend on a single piece of work. The more time we spend on
one work, the less time we have for the others. You need to
consider what you will accept as an acceptable first
iteration of the work and how much time you can afford. If
you can complete this with time to spare, then iterate
again to make it better. Setting personal deadlines for
tasks allows us to juggle all our different commitments and
ties back with better time management. Remember, in the
long run, it is better to have a few competent outputs
rather than one perfect one.
