A panel discussion held in MRC Gambia at The London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine, recorded in front of a live audience of
scientists in January 2020, when SARS-CoV-2 was just beginning to be
reported as an emerging infectious disease.  The panel consisted of
Andrew Page and David Baker from the Quadram Institute, Ozan Gundogdu
from LSHTM (UK), Abdul Sesay from LSHTM (Gambia) and Nick Loman from
the University of Birmingham and chaired by Suzie Hingley-Wilson from
the University of Surrey.  Questions, discussion and comments from:
Mark Pallen - Quadram Institute Muna Anjum - APHA Arnoud van Vliet -
University of Surrey Martin Antonio - LSHTM Archie Worwui - LSHTM
Unfortunately we weren't able to capture the audio from Nick Loman who
joined via Skype, but he did make really great contributions.
