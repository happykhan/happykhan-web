title: About SeqFindr
---

SeqFindr is a Python program that generates figures showing gene
presence/absence. The tool was developed by my Beatson-lab colleague,
[Mitchell Stanton-Cook](http://www.molecularfunk.org/), and I have been
also helping out with its development.

The program is still under development and is freely [available
here](https://github.com/BeatsonLab-MicrobialGenomics/SeqFindR).
