![Me](./Nabil-FareedAlikhan-portSQ.jpg "Me")

I am currently [Senior Bioinformatician at CGPS - University of Oxford](https://www.pathogensurveillance.net/). I was previously Interim Head of Informatics at [Quadram Institute Bioscience](https://quadram.ac.uk/) and I started there as a Bioinformatics Scientific Programmer with [Andrew Page](https://quadram.ac.uk/people/andrew-page/). Before that I was a Senior Research Fellow with
[Mark Achtman](https://royalsociety.org/people/mark-achtman-10964/) at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/med/research/biomedical/labs/machtman/achtmanlab/).

I completed my PhD in 2015, under the supervision of [Scott
Beatson](http://www.aidrc.org.au/scott-beatson) at the [University of
Queensland](http://www.aidrc.org.au/). I graduated from UQ with a
Bachelor of Information Technology and a Bachelor of Science in 2008.

Press photos. e.g. I'm giving a talk and you want to put a photo of me in your seminar notice. There are variety of moods to pick from.

### Current projects

- [Health Protection Research Unit in Genomics and Enabling Data](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/hpruged/) develops scalable, robust statistical methods and open-source tools using genomic, metagenomic, and epidemiological data to enhance public health and respond to emerging threats.
- [The Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology (PHA4GE)](https://pha4ge.org/) - I contribute to the infrastructure working group, aiming to find consensus in how we deploy Bioinformatics for public health across the world.
- Population genetics and pathogenesis of enteric pathogens, including _Salmonella_ and _E. coli_ - I dabble in research projects, see [my list of publications](/publications) for details
