I am currently Interim Head of Informatics at [Quadram Institute Bioscience](https://quadram.ac.uk/). I was previously a Bioinformatics Scientific Programmer with [Andrew Page](https://quadram.ac.uk/people/andrew-page/) at [Quadram Institute Bioscience](https://quadram.ac.uk/). Before that I was a Senior Research Fellow with
[Mark Achtman](https://royalsociety.org/people/mark-achtman-10964/) at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/med/research/biomedical/labs/machtman/achtmanlab/).

I completed my PhD in 2015, under the supervision of [Scott
Beatson](http://www.aidrc.org.au/scott-beatson) at the [University of
Queensland](http://www.aidrc.org.au/). I graduated from UQ with a
Bachelor of Information Technology and a Bachelor of Science in 2008.

### Current projects

- [COG UK Consortium](https://www.cogconsortium.uk/about/) National effort for tracking COVID19 (SARSCoV2) through genome sequencing - I contribute analysis and data curation for our data in the Quadram Institute.
- [Building better bioinformatics infrastructure within Quadram Institute](https://www.climb.ac.uk/press-release-from-qib/), moving towards open web platforms and cloud computing - I co-develop and maintain our in-house platforms.
- [The Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology (PHA4GE)](https://pha4ge.org/) - I contribute to the infrastructure working group, aiming to find consensus in how we deploy Bioinformatics for public health across the world.
- Population genetics and pathogenesis of enteric pathogens, including _Salmonella_ and _E. coli_ - I dabble in research projects, see [my list of publications](/publications) for details
