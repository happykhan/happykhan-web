# Current projects

- [COG UK Consortium](https://www.cogconsortium.uk/about/) National effort for tracking COVID19 (SARSCoV2) through genome sequencing - I contribute analysis and data curation for our data in the Quadram Institute.
- [Building better bioinformatics infrastructure within Quadram Institute](https://www.climb.ac.uk/press-release-from-qib/), moving towards open web platforms and cloud computing - I co-develop and maintain our in-house platforms.
- [The Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology (PHA4GE)](https://pha4ge.org/) - I contribute to the infrastructure working group, aiming to find consensus in how we deploy Bioinformatics for public health across the world.
- Population genetics and pathogenesis of enteric pathogens, including _Salmonella_ and _E. coli_, see [my list of publications](/publications) for details

**Media for reconstructing a _Salmonella_ genome from 800 years ago**

The article describing [the reconstruction of a _Salmonella_ genome from 800 years ago](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.cub.2018.05.058) picked up a lot of press. I'm quite proud it got into Newsweek.
