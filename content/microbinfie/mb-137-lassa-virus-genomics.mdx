On this episode we are joined by Sara Zufan to discuss her PhD journey
and recent projects. The episode covers various research experiences
and challenges in the field, including the rapid detection of AMR
using nanopore sequencing, COVID-19 projects, hepatitis A outbreak
investigations, and Lassa virus surveillance in Liberia. The guests
share insights into their professional journeys, their experiences
working across different continents, and the future of microbial
bioinformatics research.
