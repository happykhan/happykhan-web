# Discussion on Systematics: SeqCode

---

## Topic

Today, we are discussing systematics with a focus on SeqCode, a nomenclatural code designed for prokaryotes, which is described using sequence data.

## Guest Speakers

### Marike Palmer
- **Position**: Postdoctoral Researcher
- **Affiliation**: School of Life Sciences, University of Nevada, Las Vegas

### Miguel Rodriguez
- **Position**: Assistant Professor of Bioinformatics
- **Affiliations**:
  - Department of Microbiology, University of Innsbruck
  - Digital Science Center (DiSC)

## Overview

Join the conversation with Marike Palmer and Miguel Rodriguez, who are co-authors of the recent publication on SeqCode. They will share insights into the development and implementation of this nomenclatural code tailored for prokaryotes based on sequence data. 

SeqCode aims to advance the field of systematics by providing a standardized framework for naming and organizing prokaryotes in the context of molecular and genetic research.

The guest speakers on the MicroBinfeed podcast are Marika Palmer and Miguel Rodriguez. Marika Palmer is a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Life Sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and Miguel Rodriguez is an assistant professor of bioinformatics at the University of Innsbruck in the Departments of Microbiology and the Digital Science Center.
