The microbinfie podcast explores systematics and nomenclature in microbial classification, focusing on SeqCode, a novel approach to naming prokaryotes using genomic sequence data.

We are joined by co-authors of the recent publication on this topic:

- **Marike Palmer**: Postdoctoral researcher in the School of Life Sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
- **Miguel Rodriguez**: Assistant Professor of Bioinformatics at the University of Innsbruck, specializing in the Department of Microbiology and the Digital Science Center (DiSC).

SeqCode represents a significant development in the classification and naming of prokaryotes based on sequence data, offering a modern approach to microbial taxonomy.

### Key Points

#### 1. Systematics and Nomenclature
- Systematics involves classification and naming of biological organisms
- Taxonomy differs from nomenclature, with nomenclature focusing on naming rules
- Stable naming is crucial for scientific communication

#### 2. SeqCode Challenges
- Previous nomenclature systems required physical bacterial cultures for naming
- Candidatus naming lacked regulation and created naming inconsistencies
- Genome sequences can now serve as type material for prokaryotic classification

#### 3. Principles of Naming
- Principle of priority ensures unique, stable taxonomic names
- Nomenclatural types anchor taxonomic classifications
- Taxonomic freedom is preserved while establishing naming conventions

### Take-Home Messages
- Genomic data enables more flexible prokaryotic classification
- Stable naming is essential for scientific communication and taxonomy
- SeqCode provides a modern framework for microbial nomenclature
