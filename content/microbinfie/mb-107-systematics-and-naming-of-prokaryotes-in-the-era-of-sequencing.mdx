# Systematics: Introduction to SeqCode

Today, we are discussing systematics, with a specific focus on SeqCode, a nomenclatural code for prokaryotes described from sequence data. We are joined by co-authors of the recent publication on this topic:

- **Marike Palmer**: Postdoctoral researcher in the School of Life Sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
- **Miguel Rodriguez**: Assistant Professor of Bioinformatics at the University of Innsbruck, specializing in the Department of Microbiology and the Digital Science Center (DiSC).

SeqCode represents a significant development in the classification and naming of prokaryotes based on sequence data, offering a modern approach to microbial taxonomy.
