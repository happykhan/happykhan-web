# Reacting to Bioinformatics and Science in *Jurassic Park*

In 1993, *Jurassic Park* captivated audiences with its groundbreaking use of bioinformatics and science to bring dinosaurs back to life. Andrew, Nabil, and Lee recently revisited these themes by exploring a series of YouTube clips. Here's a look at their reactions and insights.

## YouTube Clips Discussed

- [Jurassic Park Scene 2](https://youtu.be/RLz5Api676Y?si=D6nps33O42Fmk4Ac)
- [Jurassic Park Scene 3](https://youtu.be/0Nz8YrCC9X8?si=KNwkeFoS6Bu4LOpv)
- [Jurassic Park Scene 4](https://youtu.be/dxIPcbmo1_U?si=TOBw5AONYVCW0JzV)
- [Jurassic Park Scene 5](https://youtu.be/m1lc8GwBKFE?si=rj7Oiq51l2_dB6ro)

## Key Areas of Focus

### Bioinformatics

The film illustrates the use of advanced genetics and bioinformatics to recreate dinosaurs. This involves extracting DNA from amber-preserved mosquitoes and filling in the missing sequences with frog DNA. The debate about the feasibility and ethical implications of such technologies makes for an engaging discussion.

### Scientific Accuracy

While the visual depiction of DNA extraction and manipulation was state-of-the-art for its time, today's audiences might critique the scientific accuracy. However, *Jurassic Park* successfully pioneered the popularization of genetic engineering concepts.

### Ethics of Genetic Manipulation

The movie also delves into the ethical aspects of genetic manipulation, a topic that remains relevant. The discussion focuses on what boundaries should exist around cloning and the potential consequences of such actions.

## Fun Fact

An interesting tidbit explored further in the podcast episode linked below is Jeff Goldblum’s secret tattoo as Dr. Ian Malcolm. Discover more about this hidden detail:
