In this episode, Andrew, Nabil, and Lee react to the depiction of bioinformatics and science as presented in the 1993 film *Jurassic Park*. 

We focused on several YouTube clips and additional resources as listed below:

## Additional Information

- For more insights into a specific narrative element of the film, such as Jeff Goldblum's character Dr. Ian Malcolm's secret tattoo, check out this detailed podcast episode: [Jeff Goldblum’s Secret Tattoo in *Jurassic Park*](https://underunderstood.com/podcast/episode/jeff-goldblums-secret-tattoo-jurassic-park-ian-malcolm).

## Discussion Points

- **Bioinformatics Depictions**: The film famously utilizes *Deoxyribonucleic acid* (DNA) sequencing as a central plot device. The way the movie envisions genetic engineering and biotechnology has sparked discussions regarding accuracy and creativity.

- **Scientific Accuracy vs. Dramatic Effect**: While *Jurassic Park* takes creative liberties, it also introduces complex scientific ideas like cloning and genetic splicing to a broader audience. We discuss what was scientifically feasible then versus now.

- **Cultural Impact**: The film has undeniably impacted both the public's perception of genetic engineering and the scientific community's understanding of communicating complex concepts to a lay audience.

By exploring these aspects, Andrew, Nabil, and Lee delve into the intersection of science and entertainment, examining how *Jurassic Park* continues to captivate and influence discussions in bioinformatics and beyond.

### Key Points

#### 1. Ancient DNA and Genomic Limitations
- DNA degradation makes retrieving million-year-old genetic material scientifically impossible
- The film's premise of extracting dinosaur DNA from amber-trapped mosquitoes is fundamentally flawed
- Genome size and sequencing challenges were accurately hinted at, despite creative liberties

#### 2. Scientific Representation in Media
- The film introduced complex genetic concepts to a broader public audience
- Narrative prioritized dramatic storytelling over strict scientific accuracy
- Highlighted emerging scientific understanding of dinosaur-bird evolutionary relationships

#### 3. Technological Visualization
- Depicted futuristic bioinformatics tools like 3D DNA visualization and virtual reality interfaces
- Lab equipment and research environments were stylized for cinematic appeal
- Represented early-1990s perspectives on computational biology

### Take-Home Messages
- Scientific films can spark public interest in complex research domains
- Creative interpretation of science must balance accuracy with storytelling
- Technological and scientific understanding evolves rapidly over decades
