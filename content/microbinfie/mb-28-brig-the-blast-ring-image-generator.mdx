We had the opportunity to speak with Nabil-Fareed Alikhan about his bioinformatics software, **BRIG**, which stands for **BLAST Ring Image Generator**. This tool is an innovative development in the field of bioinformatics, and provides a comprehensive way to visualize BLAST comparisons.

### About BRIG

BRIG is designed to assist researchers in representing genomic sequence data in a visually intuitive format. It generates circular images that represent BLAST comparisons, helping researchers easily compare bacterial genomes.

- **Software**: [BRIG SourceForge](http://brig.sourceforge.net/)
- **Paper**: [BRIG BMC Genomics Article](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-12-402)

For those interested in genome visualization and analysis, Nabil-Fareed Alikhan's work offers a valuable tool that combines functionality with user-friendly graphics to enhance bioinformatics research.

### Extra notes

- **Software Tools and Data Inputs**: The discussion revolves around *BRIG*, a graphical user tool designed for visualizing genomic data. It accepts input formats such as GenBank, FASTA, and MultiFASTA, and displays results in a circular comparison plot. Users designate one genome as the reference, with others being compared to it. This visualization allows for easy identification of conserved and non-conserved regions.

- **Integration with BLAST**: *BRIG* integrates with BLAST for sequence alignment. Although it doesn't install BLAST, it utilizes the version the user points it to, supporting both Legacy BLAST and BLAST Plus. The tool simplifies the use of BLAST by automating command-line processes, which lowers the entry barrier for new users unfamiliar with command-line operations.

- **Visualization and Customization**: The tool generates publication-ready figures, offering features like adding annotations and customizing visualization thresholds. Its intuitive representation is crucial for comparing large genomic datasets, and it continues to be popular for plasmid analyses and other genomic comparisons.

- **Development Background**: Initially created as a PhD project, *BRIG* evolved from a simple script to a comprehensive tool over several months. The image rendering is based on *CGView*, a pre-existing package that was adapted.

- **Software Engineering Choices**: *BRIG* was developed using Java due to the developer's proficiency with the language at the time. However, the lack of unit tests and strong testing frameworks is a noted regret, making future updates challenging.

- **User Experience and Documentation**: The tool is noted for its ease of use and comprehensive manual, which provides detailed guidance for users unfamiliar with the domain. The documentation is available alongside the software, packaged as a Java archive for straightforward installation.

- **Figure Optimization and Representation Limitations**: Significant effort was invested in optimizing figure generation to handle multiple sequences efficiently, avoiding excessive computational loads. However, limitations exist, such as the static nature of the figures and dependency on a reference genome, which can obscure certain genomic features.

- **Future Considerations**: There are plans and desires to expand *BRIG*, potentially transitioning to a more suitable programming language and including command-line functionalities to satisfy ongoing user requests.

- **Community and Collaboration**: The development process was collaborative, involving feedback from various researchers and users, which was integral to refining *BRIG* and ensuring it met the needs of a diverse user base.
