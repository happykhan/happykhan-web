# Interview with Nabil-Fareed Alikhan on BRIG

We had the opportunity to chat with Nabil-Fareed Alikhan about the bioinformatics software he authored, called BRIG (BLAST Ring Image Generator).

## About BRIG

**BRIG (BLAST Ring Image Generator)** is a bioinformatics tool designed for visualizing comparative genomics data. It utilizes BLAST analysis results to generate circular representations of genome comparisons, making it easier for researchers to interpret complex genomic relationships.

- **Software:** [BRIG on SourceForge](http://brig.sourceforge.net/)
- **Research Paper:** [Published Paper on BMC Genomics](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-12-402)

In the interview, Nabil discussed the development and application of BRIG in the field of bioinformatics, emphasizing its utility in visualizing genomic data in a clear and interpretable manner. BRIG has become a valuable tool for researchers studying the relationships between different genomic sequences.

For more information, you can visit the software's website or read the published paper to dive deeper into the specifics of BRIG and its applications in genomic research.

### Extra notes

- **Software Development for Microbial Bioinformatics**:
  - Discussion about the development of Brig, a graphical tool for visualizing genome comparisons.
  - Brig allows users to input sequences in formats like GenBank, FASTA, and compares them to a reference genome, displaying results as concentric rings.

- **Technical Features of Brig**:
  - Integrated BLAST functionality which operates under the hood, without needing users to run it manually in the command line.
  - Compatibility with both legacy NCBI BLAST and the newer BLAST Plus.
  - Designed with ease of use in mind, reportedly having a well-written manual.

- **Visualization and Customization**:
  - Offers customization of visual elements such as annotations and thresholds.
  - Known for its intuitive visual output, being publication-ready with support for SVG and PNG formats.
  - Supports large-scale visualization, maintaining efficiency even with complex datasets.

- **Development and Challenges**:
  - Originally created using Java with a focus on GUI, influenced by familiarity and technical constraints at the time.
  - Development involved significant optimization to handle overlapping BLAST results efficiently.
  - Notable regret in lacking automated test suites, impacting the ability to implement major updates or changes.

- **Input and Output Limitations**:
  - The static nature of its visualizations prevents interactive exploration, such as zooming on specific regions.
  - Dependency on a central reference genome limits the visualization scope, potentially missing features not present in the reference.

- **Community and Collaboration**:
  - User feedback played a critical role in iterative development.
  - Development was kickstarted as a shared project challenge within a research group.
  - Brig's unique selling point is its ease of use, attributed to community input and effective documentation.

- **Future Directions**:
  - Potential interest in re-implementing Brig with modern technologies for enhanced functionality, including possible command-line support.

- **Additional Features and Ideas**:
  - Handling additional file formats (e.g., BED, WIG).
  - Interest in incorporating interactive elements for more dynamic analysis.
  - The desire for adding features like alternative color palettes and fun easter eggs. 

This discussion highlights the intricacies involved in creating bioinformatics tools, balancing between functionality, user-friendliness, and technical constraints.
