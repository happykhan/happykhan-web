# Taxonomy Assignment in Metagenomics: A Conversation with Titus Brown

In this episode, Andrew Page and Lee Katz continue their discussion with Titus Brown, focusing on the theme of taxonomy assignment in the field of metagenomics. The episode covers several critical topics within this domain:

## Topics Discussed

- **Dealing with Contamination and Low-Quality Genomes**
  - Addressing issues present in reference databases.

- **Sourmash's Role**
  - Exploring Sourmash as a versatile search tool that serves a different function compared to curated databases.

- **Importance of High Confidence in Taxonomic Assignment for Public Health**
  - Discussing the necessity of high-confidence assignments, especially in public health contexts.

- **Microbial Assignment Tools**
  - Evaluating the low specificity or sensitivity present in most tools.
  - Exploring possible approaches to achieve perfect species classification, even if only theoretically.

- **Challenges in Defining Species**
  - The difficulty of defining species based on subtle genomic differences.

- **Unique Cryptography Concepts**
  - Introducing the concept of 'unicity distance' from cryptography for classification purposes.

- **Conveying Nuances and Uncertainties**
  - Emphasizing the importance of conveying the complexities and uncertainties involved in taxonomic assignments.

## Overview

The conversation delves into the intricate challenges surrounding taxonomic classification, especially at the species level. It explores potential methods for improving accuracy and underscores the complexities inherent in biological systems. A key takeaway is the necessity for transparent communication of uncertainties.

This episode provides valuable insights into the complexities of taxonomy assignments in metagenomics and fuels discussions on improving the current methodologies and tools used in the field.

## Additional summary:

- **Handling Poor Quality References:** SourMash is designed to search extensive databases like GenBank, which includes around 1.3 million bacterial genomes. The challenge is the presence of low-quality references. SourMash's approach is to allow the use of all available reference sequences without filtering.

- **Reference Databases:** The Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB) is praised for providing transparent quality metrics and a broad representation of bacterial and archaeal life despite some poor-quality sequences.

- **Microbial Bioinformatics Tools:** The discussion highlights that many tools for microbial analysis are either lacking in sensitivity or specificity. There's a lack of tools that can reliably perform species-level taxonomic assignments with high accuracy.

- **SourMash's Robustness:** SourMash is noted for its robustness against contamination due to its design principles. It allows researchers to use any database and focuses on providing flexibility rather than filtering results based on perceived quality.

- **Tool Development Philosophy:** The podcast emphasizes the Unix philosophy, where each tool should do one thing well. SourMash adheres to this by allowing exhaustive database searches without making decisions about the quality of the reference data.

- **Technical Challenges:** The field of microbial bioinformatics struggles with compatibility issues between tools and managing dependencies. There's a repeated need to reinvent tools due to reliance on short-term grants and the transfer of knowledge being inadequate.

- **Taxonomic Classification:** A major challenge is achieving reliable species-level classification. SourMash utilizes a concept from cryptography known as "unicity" to identify unique k-mers that differentiate genomes, potentially leading to a high accuracy in taxonomic assignment.

- **Future Directions:** There's ongoing development to enhance the precision of species identification, which is deemed crucial for applications like public health. There's also a focus on ensuring future tools maintain or exceed the quality standards set by current tools like SourMash.

- **Community Contributions:** The role of foundational tools like SourMash and SAMtools is crucial, as they form the basis for further development in bioinformatics pipelines.

- **Publication and Documentation:** There's an emphasis on learning from existing tools and publishing findings to avoid repeating past mistakes, ensuring future developments start from an informed baseline.

- **Complexity of Biological Data:** The discussion acknowledges the complexity inherent in biological systems and the challenge of translating computational insights accurately into biological understanding.
