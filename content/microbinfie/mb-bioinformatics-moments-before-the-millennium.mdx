In this episode we talk to Professor Mark Pallen, who discusses the
highlights from his long career as a medical microbiologist turned
bioinformatician. His bioinformatics journey began in 1977, the year
Fred Sanger invented DNA sequencing-as-we know-it, when Mark was
tasked with assembling some amino acid sequences under exam
conditions. Mark explains how little was know about sequences at the
time. Luckily he managed to gain a grasp of molecular biology and
joined a group in the late 1908s at Barts Hospital in London, where he
met Brendan Wren. Mark's first eureka moment followed shortly
afterwards, when he analysed sequences encoding the key enzyme urease
from Helicobacter pylori. He also got very excited when he analysed
genes from a clostridial butanol fermentation pathway, which he
explains, played a central role in the formation of the state of
Israel. His next big break came when he got the chance to do a PhD
under Gordon Dougan. During this time, Mark not only improved his lab
and bioinformatics skills, but captained a winning team in University
Challenge and introduced the medical profession to the Internet. He
recalls with excitement the moment when he first heard the news that a
bacterial genome had been sequenced. Shortly afterwards he recruited
an 18-year old gap year student, Nick Loman, to come and work with him
analysing the very first Campylobacter jejuni genome. We close this
episode just as the new millennium begins, with much more excitement
to follow in the next episode.  Relevant links: Butanol -
