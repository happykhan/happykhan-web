In this microbinfie podcast episode, Lee Katz discusses MASHtree, a rapid bioinformatics tool for comparing microbial genomes and generating approximate phylogenetic trees using MinHash algorithms.

The podcast discusses the development and implementation of *MASHtree*, a tool leveraging the *MASH* and *MinHash* algorithms to rapidly compare microbial genomes and build phylogenetic trees.

*MASHtree* uses the concept of *k-mers* to minimize the data size, transforming it into a smaller footprint (e.g., 15 MB raw data to an 8 KB sketch file), which significantly accelerates genomic comparisons.

The core of the algorithm involves converting the *k-mers* into integers and retaining the first 1,000, creating a much smaller, manageable dataset ideal for rapid computation.

*MASH distances* generated by the tool align comparably to Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI), providing a quality approximation of phylogenetic relationships without needing fully assembled genomes.

*MASHtree* utilizes a *neighbor-joining* algorithm to assemble the tree, which provides an approximation rather than a full phylogeny, focusing on clustering genomes based on proximity and similarity without inferring evolutionary ancestry.

**Tools and Methodologies**:

- **MASH (MinHash)**: Originally adapted from web technology (AltaVista) used to identify duplicate web pages quickly, it was repurposed for bioinformatics to compare genomic data efficiently.

- **k-mers and Sketching**: Used to reduce the genomic data size for faster processing. Each *k-mer* is converted into an integer, and a subset is used to create a "sketch" representative of the whole genome.

- **Neighbor-Joining Algorithm**: Selected over UPGMA due to better performance in approximating the desired phylogenetic trees.

- **Software Development**: *MASHtree* is written in Perl, chosen for its practicality and multithreading capabilities at the time of initial development. It's packaged for easy installation via CPAN and includes comprehensive unit testing.

**Challenges and Limitations**:

- The main limitation is that *MASHtree* does not produce true phylogenetic trees but rather approximated dendrograms or clustering trees. The tool cannot infer ancestral states or detailed evolutionary paths.

- The need for scalability: Earlier attempts in software, such as *Saffron Tree*, did not scale well due to the exponential increase in computational demand with more genomes.

- Error profiles in data from different sequencing technologies (e.g., MinION) need separate testing to ensure compatibility and accuracy.

**Future Directions and Improvements**:

- There are aspirations to generalize the *MASHtree* pipeline, allowing it to accept various distance metrics as input, broadening its applicability across different types of genomic comparisons.

- The community has incorporated *MASHtree* into broader pipelines, notably in Australia, where it is part of rapid outbreak data assessment.
