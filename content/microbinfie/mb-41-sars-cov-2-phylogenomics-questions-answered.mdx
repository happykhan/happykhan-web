# Panel Discussion on SARS-CoV-2 Phylogenomics

**Presented by:** ARTICnetwork & CLIMB-BIG-DATA

**Panelists:**

- **Nick Loman** - University of Birmingham
- **Verity Hill** - University of Edinburgh
- **Andrew Page** - Quadram Institute
- **Anna Price** - MRC CLIMB and Cardiff University

This discussion was part of a broader workshop focused on COVID-19 data analysis.

## Topics Covered:

- **More about Polecat**: Understanding its utility in the analysis of SARS-CoV-2.
- **COG-UK Phylotypes vs. Pangolin Lineages**: Exploring the differences between these classifications.
- **Civet and Llama**: Differentiating these tools and their use case scenarios.
- **Using BLAST for SARS-CoV-2**: Can it identify similar genomes?
- **Finding Similar Sequences**: Techniques for placing sample sequences in context using public repositories.
- **Manual Curation for PangoLEARN**: Understanding the process and its importance.
- **Subtree Selection in Civet**: Criteria and methods used in defining subtrees.
- **Adaptation of Civet for Other Viruses**: Exploring broader applications beyond SARS-CoV-2.
- **Vaccine Sequences Availability**: Where and how these sequences can be accessed.
- **Databases Reporting Variation**: An overview of resources tracking genomic variations.
- **Quality of Variant Calls**: Discussing the reliability and accuracy of variant assessments.
