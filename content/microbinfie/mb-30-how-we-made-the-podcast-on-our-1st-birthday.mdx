# Celebrating Our Podcast's First Anniversary

To commemorate a full year of our podcast since our debut episode on September 19, 2019, we've decided to delve into the origin story of our journey. In this special anniversary episode, we explore the following topics:

- **How We Met**: A look back at the beginning of our friendship and collaboration.
  
- **Why We Started the Podcast**: The inspiration and motivation that led us to dive into the world of podcasting.
  
- **How We Actually Started It**: A behind-the-scenes look at the process from concept to launch, including the challenges and triumphs we encountered along the way.

Join us as we celebrate this milestone and reflect on the incredible journey of our podcast. Thank you for sticking with us through this amazing year!
