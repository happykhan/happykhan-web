# Exploring NFTs and Blockchain in Genomics and Bioinformatics

In this article, we dive into the fascinating world of NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and blockchain, and explore in a light-hearted manner how these technologies could revolutionize genomics and bioinformatics. We even propose a novel concept: replacing all central genome databases with our very own cryptocurrency, tentatively named BioBucks or GenomeCoin.

## Genomics and Blockchain

The Myriad Genetics Supreme Court Case is a pivotal point in the discussion of genomics and intellectual property. For more information, you can read the Supreme Court's decision on the matter [here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-398_1b7d.pdf).

To further understand the complexities surrounding gene patenting, consider checking out a Planet Money episode on the topic, the transcript of which is available [here](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/937167323).

## NFTs and Their Potential

The world of NFTs gained massive attention with events such as Beeple's digital artwork auction at Christie's, where the piece sold for $69 million. Read more about this groundbreaking sale [here](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million).

If you're curious about creating NFTs yourself, you might find this guide on how to create, buy, and sell NFTs useful: [CoinDesk Guide](https://www.coindesk.com/how-to-create-buy-sell-nfts).

### Conclusion

While the idea of integrating NFTs and blockchain into genomics may seem far-fetched today, it holds intriguing possibilities for decentralization and innovation in the field. The intersection of cutting-edge technology and genetic science could lead to unprecedented advancements and efficiencies. Who knows what the future of genomics might hold?

The speakers on the microbial bioinformatics podcast are Dr. Lee Katz, Dr. Nabil Ali Khan, and Dr. Andrew Page. They are experts in the field, discussing various topics including microbial bioinformatics and, in this episode, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in a manner that connects these ideas with their work in the Quadram Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
