# PHA4GE SARS-CoV-2 Contextual Data Specification for Open Genomic Epidemiology

In a recent conversation with Dr. Emma Griffiths (UBC), Dr. Ruth Timme (FDA), and Dr. Duncan MacCannell (CDC), we discussed the PHA4GE SARS-CoV-2 contextual data specification. This initiative aims to enhance open genomic epidemiology amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. 

## Key Resources

- **Paper**: [https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202008.0220/v1](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202008.0220/v1)
- **Specification**: [https://github.com/pha4ge/SARS-CoV-2-Contextual-Data-Specification](https://github.com/pha4ge/SARS-CoV-2-Contextual-Data-Specification)
- **Protocols**: [https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/pha4ge](https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/pha4ge)

## About PHA4GE

[The Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology (PHA4GE)](https://pha4ge.org) is a global coalition focused on:

- Establishing consensus standards
- Documenting and sharing best practices
- Improving the availability of bioinformatic tools and resources
- Advocating for greater openness, interoperability, accessibility, and reproducibility in public health microbial bioinformatics

## The Contextual Data Specification

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, PHA4GE recognized the need for a tailored, open-source SARS-CoV-2 contextual data standard. The specification is an extension to the INSDC pathogen package, formulated based on harmonizable, publicly available community standards.

### Features

- **Collection Template**: Implementable through a well-structured template for submitting sequence data and contextual information to public repositories.
- **Protocols and Tools**: A suite of tools to aid in the harmonization and submission processes.

Well-structured and rich contextual data:

- Adds value and promotes reuse.
- Enables the aggregation and integration of disparate data sets.
- Fosters interoperability between datasets and systems.
- Improves the consistency and utility of generated data.
- Ultimately facilitates novel insights and discoveries in SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 research.

## Conclusion

The adoption of the proposed standard and practices by PHA4GE will significantly enhance the biological understanding and management of SARS-CoV-2 through structured data sharing, leading to meaningful scientific advancements.
