In this conversation, we engage with Dr. Emma Griffiths (UBC), Dr. Ruth Timme (FDA), and Dr. Duncan MacCannell (CDC) concerning the PHA4GE SARS-CoV-2 contextual data specification, designed for open genomic epidemiology.

## Resources

- **Paper**: [PHA4GE SARS-CoV-2 Contextual Data Specification](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202008.0220/v1)
- **Specification**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pha4ge/SARS-CoV-2-Contextual-Data-Specification)
- **Protocols**: [Protocols.io Workspace](https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/pha4ge)

## About PHA4GE

The Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology (PHA4GE) (visit their [website](https://pha4ge.org)) is a global coalition dedicated to:

- Establishing consensus standards
- Documenting and sharing best practices
- Improving the availability of critical bioinformatic tools and resources
- Advocating for greater openness, interoperability, accessibility, and reproducibility in public health microbial bioinformatics

## Significance of the Specification

With the ongoing pandemic, PHA4GE has recognized an urgent need for a specifically tailored, open-source *SARS-CoV-2* contextual data standard. The team has developed an extension to the INSDC pathogen package to provide a *SARS-CoV-2* contextual data specification based on harmonizable, publicly available community standards.

### Implementation

- The specification is implementable via a collection template.
- It includes various protocols and tools designed to:
  - Support the harmonization and submission of sequence data
  - Facilitate the inclusion of contextual information to public repositories

### Benefits of Rich Contextual Data

- **Adds Value**: Well-structured data increases usefulness and reusability.
- **Promotes Reuse**: Easier integration of disparate datasets.
- **Enhances Interoperability**: Improves consistency and utility across datasets and systems.
- **Facilitates Discoveries**: Enables novel insights in the study of *SARS-CoV-2* and COVID-19.

The adoption of this proposed standard will significantly improve data interoperability, ultimately leading to advances in understanding and combating *SARS-CoV-2*.
