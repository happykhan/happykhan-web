# Public Health Bioinformatics on the Cloud with WDL + Terra.bio

**Presented by: Microbial Bioinformatics**

## Overview

This presentation focuses on leveraging cloud technology for public health bioinformatics, specifically through the use of **Workflow Description Language (WDL)** and **Terra.bio**. These tools enable researchers to effectively manage and analyze large datasets associated with microbial genomes, which are crucial for public health initiatives.

## Key Components

### Workflow Description Language (WDL)

- **Purpose**: WDL is a human-readable language designed to express computational workflows.
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplifies complex computational processes.
  - Enhances reproducibility and portability of workflows.

### Terra.bio

- **Platform**: Terra.bio is a secure, scalable, and collaborative environment for conducting biomedical research in the cloud.
- **Features**:
  - **Data Management**: Facilitates storage, sharing, and management of large genomic datasets.
  - **Collaboration Tools**: Supports interdisciplinary teams by providing shared access to data and computational resources.
  - **Integrations**: Offers integration with popular bioinformatics tools and databases.

## Applications in Public Health

Utilizing WDL and Terra.bio in public health bioinformatics provides several advantages:

- **Scalability**: The cloud-based approach allows for handling increasing volumes of genomic data without the need for local infrastructure.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Reduces the overall cost of data processing and storage by utilizing pay-as-you-go cloud services.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Facilitates timely analysis and response to public health threats, such as outbreaks of infectious diseases.
- **Data Sharing**: Enhances global health collaborations by enabling easy sharing of data across borders and institutions.

## Conclusion

The integration of WDL and Terra.bio in microbial bioinformatics promotes a more efficient, scalable, and collaborative approach to public health research. By adopting these cloud-based tools, researchers are better equipped to respond to global health challenges.
