# Public Health Bioinformatics on the Cloud with WDL and Terra.bio

Presented by Microbial Bioinformatics

---

## Overview

In this session, we explore how public health bioinformatics can be effectively managed on the cloud using Workflow Description Language (WDL) and the Terra.bio platform.

### Key Topics

1. **Introduction to WDL:**
   - Understanding the Workflow Description Language.
   - Benefits of using WDL in bioinformatics workflows.

2. **Cloud Computing in Bioinformatics:**
   - Advantages of leveraging cloud computing for public health data.
   - Introduction to Terra.bio as a platform for bioinformatics.

3. **Integrating WDL with Terra.bio:**
   - Step-by-step guide on setting up workflows on Terra.bio using WDL.
   - Best practices and tips for optimizing workflows.

4. **Case Studies:**
   - Real-world examples of public health bioinformatics projects implemented using WDL and Terra.bio.
   - Lessons learned and outcomes achieved.

5. **Future Directions:**
   - Innovations in bioinformatics through cloud integration.
   - Upcoming features and tools in WDL and Terra.bio.

### Benefits of Using WDL and Terra.bio

- **Scalability:** Handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Collaboration:** Facilitate teamwork across different geographical locations.
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay for computing resources only when they are used.
- **Flexibility:** Customizable workflows tailored to specific research needs.

### Conclusion

Leveraging WDL and Terra.bio provides a powerful and flexible environment for public health bioinformatics, enhancing research capabilities and facilitating the management of complex datasets in an efficient and cost-effective manner.
