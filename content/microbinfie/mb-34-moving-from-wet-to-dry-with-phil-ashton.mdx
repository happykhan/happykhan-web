### Transitioning to Bioinformatics

**Q: What inspired your move from the wet lab to the dry lab?**

Phil: After years working hands-on in the lab, I wanted to dive deeper into the data analysis side of things. Bioinformatics offers the chance to combine my biological expertise with computational tools to derive meaningful insights. It was a natural progression for me, seeking new challenges and new ways to contribute to science.

### Experiences in Public Health

**Q: How has your background influenced your work in public health?**

Phil: My wet lab experience gave me a solid foundation in understanding biological processes, which is crucial in public health applications. Working with real samples and understanding their complexities helps frame the bioinformatic analyses I conduct. The transition has allowed me to analyze data in ways that directly impact public health policies and practices.

### Working in Low and Middle Income Countries

**Q: What have been some of the highlights or challenges of working in low and middle income countries?**

Phil: One of the highlights is seeing the tangible impact of my work on communities. Working in these settings often comes with unique challenges, such as limited resources and infrastructure. However, these experiences have been invaluable for developing creative solutions and fostering collaborations that transcend borders.
