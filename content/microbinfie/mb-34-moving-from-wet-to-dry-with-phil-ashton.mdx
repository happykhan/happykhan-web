We recently had the opportunity to chat with Phil Ashton about his fascinating career transition from the wet lab to the dry lab, taking on the role of a bioinformatician. Below, Phil shares his experiences working in public health and in low and middle-income countries.

### Guests
* **Phil Ashton**, a bioinformatician at the Malawi Liverpool Welcome Unit, shares his transition from a wet lab to bioinformatics.

### Transition to Bioinformatics

Phil's journey from the wet lab, where hands-on experiments are conducted, to the dry lab, where computational analysis takes place, marks a significant shift in his scientific approach. Having a strong foundation in laboratory research provided Phil with a deep understanding of the fundamental mechanisms behind biological data, an essential asset for his current work in *bioinformatics*.

### Experiences in Public Health

Working in public health has allowed Phil to utilize his bioinformatics skills to contribute to significant health outcomes. His engagement in analyzing epidemiological data and understanding genetic information has been crucial in developing strategies to combat infectious diseases and improve community health standards.

### Contributions in Low and Middle-Income Countries

Phil's involvement in projects in low and middle-income countries highlights his commitment to global health equity. By tailoring bioinformatics tools and data analysis techniques to suit the unique challenges faced by these regions, he has helped in advancing local research capabilities and fostering international collaborations.

Through this enriching career path, Phil Ashton exemplifies how a shift from traditional laboratory work to computational biology can pave the way for impactful contributions to science and society, particularly in diverse and underserved populations.

## Extra notes

The episode discusses the different backgrounds of individuals in the bioinformatics field, which can range from computer science to bench microbiology.
