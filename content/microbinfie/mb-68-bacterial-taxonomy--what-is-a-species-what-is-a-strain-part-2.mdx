# Bacterial Taxonomy: What is a Species, What is a Strain? Part 2

*by Microbial Bioinformatics*

In this second part of our exploration into bacterial taxonomy, we delve deeper into understanding what constitutes a bacterial species and how strains within a species are differentiated.

## Understanding Bacterial Species

The definition of a bacterial species is complex and has been a subject of debate among microbiologists. Generally, a bacterial species is a collection of strains that share a high degree of genetic similarity, a common lineage, and similar phenotypic characteristics. While traditional methods for species delineation relied heavily on phenotypic characteristics, modern approaches emphasize genetic sequencing and phylogenetic analyses.

### Key Criteria for Species Definition

1. **Genetic Similarity**: Often determined by comparing sequences of specific marker genes, like the 16S rRNA gene. A common threshold is 97% similarity, although this can vary.

2. **Phylogenetic Analysis**: Involves constructing phylogenetic trees that place strains within a broader evolutionary context.

3. **Phenotypic Characteristics**: Includes observable traits such as morphology, growth conditions, and metabolic capabilities.

4. **Reproductive Isolation**: Although not as relevant in bacteria as in eukaryotes due to horizontal gene transfer, some taxonomists consider the degree of recombination.

## Defining a Strain

A strain refers to a genetic variant or subtype within a bacterial species. Each strain originates from a single cell or colony and possesses unique genetic markers or variations, which might confer specific properties such as antibiotic resistance or virulence.

### Importance of Strains

1. **Pathogenicity**: Certain strains might be pathogenic while others are harmless.
   
2. **Antibiotic Resistance**: Strains can exhibit variability in resistance to antibiotics.

3. **Biotechnological Applications**: Specific strains might be used for industrial or research applications based on their capabilities.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for microbiologists in identifying, classifying, and utilizing bacterial organisms in both clinical and environmental contexts. As genomic technologies advance, these definitions continue to evolve, offering more precise ways to classify and understand bacterial diversity.
