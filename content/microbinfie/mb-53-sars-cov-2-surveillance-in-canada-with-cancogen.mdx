The microbinfie podcast explores SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in Canada, highlighting the complex, decentralized approach to pandemic research and data sharing across multiple provinces and institutions.

Join guest host Dr. Emma Griffiths as she engages in an insightful conversation with Dr. Finlay McGuire and Dr. William Hsiao about the *SARS-CoV-2* genomics epidemiology efforts in Canada. Discover how the scientific community is uncovering valuable insights to fight COVID-19 through cutting-edge research and collaboration. 

Explore more about these efforts by visiting the [Cancogen website](https://www.genomecanada.ca/en/cancogen).


### Key Points

#### 1. Canadian COVID-19 Genomic Surveillance
- Highly variable pandemic impact across provinces, with case counts ranging dramatically
- Genomic sequencing coverage differs widely, from 1.9% to 46% in different regions
- Collaborative national network (Cancogen) coordinates sequencing efforts

#### 2. Decentralized Health System Challenges
- Provincial health authorities control data collection and sharing
- National Microbiology Lab serves as central coordination point
- Data sharing agreements are ongoing and complex

#### 3. Genomic Research Infrastructure
- Multiple institutions involved: academic, public health, and provincial labs
- Leveraging existing networks like Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network
- Integrating viral and host genome sequencing for comprehensive research

### Take-Home Messages
- Canada's COVID-19 response demonstrates flexible, collaborative scientific approach
- Genomic surveillance requires significant inter-provincial coordination
- Pandemic research benefits from distributed but interconnected research networks
