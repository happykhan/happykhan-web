## Part 2: A New Method for Identifying Variants of Concern Using Sanger Sequencing

In this segment, we explore a novel method for identifying variants of concern (VOCs), utilizing **Sanger sequencing**. We are joined by the developers of this method, Kai Blin and Tue Jorgensen, both affiliated with the *Technical University of Denmark*.

### Resources:

- **Preprint:** [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2….03.27.21252266v1)
- **Protocol:** [Protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/view/sanger-sequ%E2%80%A6-2-spik-bsbdnai6)
- **Software:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kblin/covid-spike-classification)
- **Web App:** [SSI BioLib](https://ssi.biolib.com/app/covid-spike-classification/run)

These links provide access to the preprint article, the detailed experimental protocol, the open-source software repository, and a web application for running COVID-19 spike classification. This method represents a significant advancement in the rapid identification and classification of potentially harmful variants.
