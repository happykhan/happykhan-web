## Part 2: A New Method for Identifying Variants of Concern Using Sanger Sequencing

In this segment, we explore a novel method for identifying variants of concern (VOC) using Sanger sequencing. Joining us are the authors of this innovative approach, Kai Blin and Tue Jorgensen, both affiliated with the Technical University of Denmark.

### Publications and Resources

- **Preprint**: Details of their study can be found in their preprint available at [medRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2.03.27.21252266v1).
- **Protocol**: The step-by-step protocol for their method is published on [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/view/sanger-sequ-2-spik-bsbdnai6).
- **Software**: The software developed for this sequencing classification can be accessed on [GitHub](https://github.com/kblin/covid-spike-classification).
- **Web App**: An online application to run this classification process is available on [SSI BioLib](https://ssi.biolib.com/app/covid-spike-classification/run).

This method promises to enhance the identification and tracking of COVID-19 variants, an essential step in managing and mitigating the pandemic.
