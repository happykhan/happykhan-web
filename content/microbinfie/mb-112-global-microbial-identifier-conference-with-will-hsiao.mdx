### Extra notes

- **Equity and Diversity**: The conference focused on including diverse groups, such as participants from low- and middle-income countries, First Nations, and marginalized communities. This approach aims to improve data-sharing processes and ensure equitable participation.

- **Social Science Integration**: Emphasis on integrating social sciences into bioinformatics to enhance data-sharing practices and design more inclusive and equitable technological solutions.

- **Conference Challenges**: Difficulties in inviting participants due to overlapping events, such as a simultaneous major First Nations conference, highlighting logistical issues in organizing diverse events.

- **Interoperability**: Interoperability was a key theme discussed at the conference. The goal is to improve buy-in and equity by considering diverse perspectives during the design of technological solutions in bioinformatics.

- **Gender Balance**: The conference was noted for its gender balance, which is particularly uncommon in fields like mathematics, indicating a conscious effort to address gender disparities.

- **Participant Engagement**: There was high engagement and diversity in discussions, which exceeded the organizers’ expectations and highlighted the richness of perspectives brought by a broad range of participants.

- **Technological Design**: The technological design in bioinformatics can benefit from social perspectives, aiming for better practice and equity in the field.

Overall, the podcast highlighted the importance of diversity, social science integration, equity, and interoperability in microbial bioinformatics conferences. The focus was on creating a more inclusive environment that considers a wide range of voices and perspectives.

The guest speakers on the Microbial Bioinformatics podcast are Dr. Lee Katz, Dr. Nabil Ali Khan, Professor Andrew Page, and Will Hsiao. Dr. Katz and Dr. Khan co-host the podcast with Professor Page, and Will Hsiao is a special guest who is an Associate Professor at Simon Fraser University.
