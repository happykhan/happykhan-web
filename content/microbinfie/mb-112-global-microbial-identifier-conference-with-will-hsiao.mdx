- **Data Sharing and Social Sciences**: The conference emphasizes enhancing data-sharing processes with social sciences to create a more equitable system rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

- **Equity and Diversity**: An increased focus on equity and diversity is highlighted, particularly by involving low- and middle-income countries and marginalized communities like the First Nations.

- **Critical Event Planning**: Despite challenges such as event clashes (e.g., concurrent First Nations conference), efforts were made to include diverse voices.

- **Engagement and Diversity**: Expectations were exceeded by the level of engagement and richness of discussions, showcasing the importance of diverse participation in bioinformatics conferences.

- **Technological Solutions with Social Integration**: The integration of social perspectives in technological developments aims to make scientific practices more inclusive and widely accepted.
