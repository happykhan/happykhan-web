# What's Next for Nextstrain? 

**By Microbial Bioinformatics**

## Introduction

Nextstrain has been at the forefront of genomic epidemiology, providing invaluable insights during the COVID-19 pandemic and other microbial epidemics. As we look forward, several key developments and innovations are poised to shape the future of this powerful tool.

## Continued Evolution of Nextstrain

- **Increased Data Integration**: Nextstrain aims to integrate more diverse datasets, including genomic, clinical, and ecological data, to enhance understanding of pathogen evolution and spread.

- **Enhanced Visualization Tools**: Improving the accessibility and utility of visualizations for a broader audience, from scientists to policymakers, is a priority. This may involve user-friendly interfaces and customizable visualization options.

- **Real-time Analysis Capabilities**: Speeding up the analysis pipeline to provide near real-time insights can significantly aid in rapid response efforts during outbreaks.

- **Expand Pathogen Coverage**: While initially focused on influenza and SARS-CoV-2, expanding to include other pathogens of interest, like bacteria and fungi, will broaden the scope and impact.

## Community Engagement and Collaboration

- **Fostering Community Contributions**: Encouraging contributions from a global community of scientists can enhance the robustness and scope of Nextstrain's capabilities.

- **Collaborations with Public Health Institutions**: Strengthening ties with public health bodies ensures that Nextstrain's developments align closely with real-world needs.

## Future Goals

- **Scalability and Accessibility**: Ensuring that the platform can scale to meet growing demand and remain accessible to even those with limited resources and computational power.

- **Educational Initiatives**: Developing resources and workshops to educate users on how to effectively utilize Nextstrain in their research and public health work.

## Conclusion

As Nextstrain continues to evolve, its ongoing commitment to innovation, collaboration, and accessibility will ensure it remains a leading tool in microbial bioinformatics. By anticipating future challenges and opportunities, Nextstrain is well-positioned to contribute significantly to global health security.
