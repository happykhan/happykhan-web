# Effective Communication in Bioinformatics

Have you ever read a paper and wondered why the author buried their key result on page 39 of a 50-page paper? Many bioinformaticians face challenges when it comes to effectively communicating their work to a broader audience. In this discussion, we focus on strategies tailored specifically for bioinformaticians to improve their communication and visibility in the scientific community. 

## Topics Discussed:

- **Online Presence and Scholarly Communications**: Effective use of platforms like Google Scholar and Scopus to enhance visibility.

- **Marketing Strategies**: Approaches for marketing research to peers and enhancing the visibility of organizational websites.

- **Managing Publication Records**: Best practices for maintaining and showcasing your publication record and making use of citation metrics.
