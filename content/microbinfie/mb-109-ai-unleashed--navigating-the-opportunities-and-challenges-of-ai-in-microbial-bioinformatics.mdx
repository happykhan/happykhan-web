# Micro Binfie Podcast: Episode "AI Unleashed: Navigating the Opportunities and Challenges of AI in Microbial Bioinformatics"

In this episode of the Micro Binfie Podcast, hosts Lee, Nabil, and Andrew explore the implications of generative predictive text AI tools, particularly GPT, on microbial bioinformatics. Here's a detailed breakdown of their discussion:

## Applications of AI in Microbial Bioinformatics

The hosts begin by discussing the various applications of AI tools in their work:

- **Boilerplate Code Generation**: AI assists in creating standard programs, drafting documents, and summarizing extensive data.
- **Coding with AI**: Andrew shares his experience using GPT for coding via VS Code and GitHub Copilot, noting that GPT can generate nearly 90% of the necessary code from a brief task description, significantly speeding up his workflow.
- **Clarifying Code with AI**: AI is also used in clarifying lines of code. For example, during a recent hackathon, they utilized AI to write a paper on the ethical considerations of using AI in microbial genomics research.

## Challenges and Limitations of AI 

The discussion shifts to Nabil's experience with GPT:

- **Task Accuracy**: Although GPT is generally accurate for simple tasks, it sometimes provides incorrect answers.
- **Complex Prompts**: GPT can deliver plausible but inaccurate responses for complicated prompts, as illustrated by an instance where Nabil used it to find a route in a video game.
- **Factual Errors**: Andrew mentions creating a script at a hackathon for podcast episodes reviewing math tools and encountering factual inaccuracies.

## Future Considerations

Andrew contemplates a future filled with GPT-generated content, emphasizing the challenge of distinguishing between real and false information. Despite current limitations, the prospects for AI technologies benefit applications for those with visual impairments.

## AI in Code Generation and Language Learning

The hosts discuss AI's role in handling boilerplate code and generating code snippets:

- **Live Experiment**: Nabil and Andrew conduct a live experiment, using a Perl script with GPT-4 to convert it into Python and back, assessing AI's proficiency in language translation. The AI tool shows capability in considering comments, usage, and authorship and employs popular libraries like BioPython, though it includes a disclaimer regarding potential inaccuracies.
  
- **Optimization and Multilingual Iteration**: They discuss AI's potential in optimizing code, akin to minifying JavaScript, and iterating through multiple languages to assess output quality.
  
- **DNA to Protein Script**: Nabil tasks the AI with writing a Python script to translate DNA into protein and subsequently translates it into Rust.
  
- **Spreadsheet Comparison with AI**: Andrew details using AI to generate a Python class for comparing two spreadsheets with pandas, showcasing AI's comprehension and execution abilities in complex tasks.

## Conclusion

This episode highlights the power and potential of AI in coding, emphasizing the necessity of human oversight to ensure quality and effectiveness of AI-generated content. It provides a glimpse into a future where AI tools, despite their limitations, could revolutionize programming, ushering in new efficiencies and work methods.

The guest speakers on the Microbial Bioinformatics podcast are Dr. Nabil Ali Khan, Professor Andrew Page, and Dr. Lee Katz.
