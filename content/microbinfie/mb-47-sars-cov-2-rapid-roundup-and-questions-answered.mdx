We present a rapid round up of SARS-CoV-2 questions and issues,
hopefully with some answers, so that you can stay on top of the latest
in SARS-CoV-2 genomics. Recorded 5 February 2021.  Topics covered: Why
missing 1 SNP can cause lineage assignment to break and how it works?
How do we describe lineages with a chain of mutation events? Are we
seeing convergent evolution? Co-infections of different lineages
discovered? For nanopore basecalling do use HAC & should you get a
GPU? Basic logistics difficult for sequencing in many parts of world.
Can I look at recombination with ARTIC on Illumina?  How do you
annotate a SARS-CoV-2 sequence?  http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/home

Scientists call for fully open sharing of coronavirus genome data:
