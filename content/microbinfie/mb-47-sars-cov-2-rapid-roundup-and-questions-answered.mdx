In this roundup, we delve into the latest questions and developments in SARS-CoV-2 genomics. This information is based on discussions and data recorded on 5 February 2021.

## Topics Covered

- **SNP and Lineage Assignment**: Explore how the absence of even a single Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) can disrupt the assignment of a viral lineage, and understand the mechanism behind it.

- **Lineage Descriptions**: How are viral lineages defined with sequences of mutation events?

- **Convergent Evolution**: Is convergent evolution occurring in SARS-CoV-2? Discover the trends being observed.

- **Co-Infections**: Have different SARS-CoV-2 lineages been found co-infecting individuals?

- **Nanopore Basecalling**: Should you use High Accuracy (HAC) basecalling, and is acquiring a GPU for this purpose beneficial?

- **Sequencing Logistics**: Address the basic logistical challenges of sequencing in various parts of the world.

- **Recombination Studies**: Can the ARTIC protocol be used alongside Illumina technology to study recombination in SARS-CoV-2?

- **Sequence Annotation**: Learn how to annotate a SARS-CoV-2 sequence.

## Useful Tools and Resources

- **COV-GLUE**: This is an essential tool for sequence annotation. Visit [COV-GLUE](http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/home) for more information.

- **Nextclade & SNPeff**: For sequence analysis:
  - Convert FASTA files using [Nextclade](https://nextstrain.org/)
  - Analyze VCF files with [SNPeff](http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/)

- **Community Spread Detection**: Use [NextStrain](https://nextstrain.org/) to spot patterns and evidence of community spread.

- **Types of Variants**: Check out the GitHub repository [cov-ert/type_variants](https://github.com/cov-ert/type_variants) for detailed information on variant types.

## Call for Open Sharing

There's a strong ongoing appeal within the scientific community for the fully open sharing of coronavirus genome data. Open sharing is critical for global collaboration and combating the pandemic effectively. Read more about these efforts in the article: [Nature Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00305-7). 

Stay informed to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving field of SARS-CoV-2 genomics.
