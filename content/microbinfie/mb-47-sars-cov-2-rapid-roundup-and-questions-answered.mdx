# Rapid Round-Up: SARS-CoV-2 Genomics

**Recorded on: 5 February 2021**

Stay informed about the latest developments in SARS-CoV-2 genomics with our rapid round-up of questions and issues.

## Topics Covered:

- **Lineage Assignment:**
  - Why can missing one SNP cause lineage assignment to break, and how does this process work?

- **Describing Lineages:**
  - How do we describe lineages using a chain of mutation events?

- **Convergent Evolution:**
  - Are we observing convergent evolution in SARS-CoV-2?

- **Co-Infections:**
  - Discovery of co-infections involving different SARS-CoV-2 lineages.

- **Nanopore Basecalling:**
  - Should you use HAC, and is acquiring a GPU beneficial?

- **Sequencing Logistics:**
  - The basic logistical challenges faced during sequencing in various parts of the world.

- **Recombination with ARTIC on Illumina:**
  - Is it possible to examine recombination events?

- **Annotation of SARS-CoV-2 Sequences:**
  - How to annotate a SARS-CoV-2 sequence using available tools like [CoV-GLUE](http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/home).

- **Data Formats for Analysis:**
  - Converting and analyzing data: FASTA to NextClade, VCF to SnpEff, and identifying variants with [Cov-ERT type_variants](https://github.com/cov-ert/type_variants).

- **Community Spread Detection:**
  - Spotting community spread of the virus using NextStrain tools.

- **Open Sharing of Genome Data:**
  - Scientists advocate for fully open sharing of coronavirus genome data. Read more on this issue [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00305-7).

Stay updated with these insights to enhance your understanding and research capabilities in SARS-CoV-2 genomics.
