The microbinfie podcast explores the development of Majora, a critical database infrastructure created during the COVID-19 pandemic to support rapid SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing across the United Kingdom.

Join Nick Loman, Sam Nicholls, and Radosław Popławski as they discuss the development of systems to support the analysis of hundreds of thousands of *SARS-CoV-2* genomes during the pandemic, notably without the use of Excel.

Learn more about MAJORA, a system for continuous integration supporting decentralized sequencing for *SARS-CoV-2* genomic surveillance. You can access the preprint [here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.06.328328).
For more information, visit the [COG-UK Consortium website](https://www.cogconsortium.uk/).

Here are the main points from the episode:

1. **Majora Database**:
   - Majora is the central database infrastructure supporting COG-UK's sequencing efforts.
   - It connects distributed sequencing hubs, integrating sequence data and sample metadata for analysis and public database uploads.

2. **Motivation for Majora**:
   - The need for an agile and flexible software solution arose from the sudden demand for rapid genome sequencing during the COVID-19 outbreak.
   - Existing systems were inadequate for the distributed nature and varied sequencing protocols of COG-UK.

3. **Development Timeline**:
   - The work on Majora began in March 2020, with a quick response to the urgent need for a user management system.
   - Initial prototypes were developed in a matter of days, showcasing the team's rapid adaptability.

4. **Technical Aspects**:
   - Majora is built on Django (Python framework) and employs Nextflow for pipeline management.
   - The design prioritizes flexibility and usability, accommodating a range of sequencing techniques and protocols.

5. **Integration and Testing**:
   - Majora's development involved collaboration with various stakeholders and was not built in isolation.
   - Testing was primarily integration-focused, with a separate test instance called "magenta" for deployment.

6. **API and Documentation**:
   - The API is a central component of Majora, with initial documentation created in Markdown.
   - Transitioned to a more structured documentation using OpenAPI specifications for better maintenance and usability.
   - A web interface developed by Anthony Underwood and his team enhances user interaction, allowing users to upload metadata efficiently.

7. **Community Contribution**:
   - The success of Majora relies on contributions from a large consortium of approximately 400-500 individuals across various institutions.
   - Collaboration and shared expertise were vital to the rapid establishment of the system.

8. **Cultural References**:
    - The name "Majora" is inspired by the video game "Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask," symbolizing its role in addressing the urgent global crisis.

### Key Points

#### 1. Majora's Origin and Purpose
- Developed rapidly in March 2020 to support COG-UK's distributed sequencing efforts
- Designed to integrate sequence data and sample metadata from multiple sequencing hubs
- Enabled flexible, agile response to the urgent need for coronavirus genomic tracking

#### 2. Technical Development
- Built on Django with Nextflow for pipeline management
- Initially started as a user management system within days of project initiation
- Leveraged existing infrastructure like the CLIMB cloud platform

#### 3. Collaborative Ecosystem
- Involved approximately 400-500 individuals across various institutions
- Developed through close collaboration and rapid prototyping
- Named after the video game "Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask" symbolizing crisis response

### Take-Home Messages
- Rapid bioinformatics solutions can emerge from collaborative, adaptable approaches
- Existing technological foundations are crucial for emergency response systems
- Distributed genomic surveillance requires flexible, scalable infrastructure
