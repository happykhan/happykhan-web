# Interview with Dr. Ozan Gundogdu

Our guest today is Dr. Ozan Gundogdu, here for a deeper dive into the foodborne pathogen *Campylobacter* and how genomics has informed the field over the past 20 years since the publication of the first reference genome in 1999. Dr. Gundogdu leads the foodborne enteric pathogen group at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, where they study the physiology and pathogenesis of *Campylobacter* and other related enteric microorganisms like *Listeria* and *Vibrio*.

Dr. Gundogdu's background is in **molecular biology** and **computer science**, and he completed his PhD at LSHTM (London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine) in 2011. For more information, you can visit his profile [here](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/gundogdu.ozan).
