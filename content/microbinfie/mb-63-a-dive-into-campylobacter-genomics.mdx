Our guest today is Dr Ozan Gundogdu for a deeper dive into the food
borne pathogen Campylobacter and how genomics has informed the field
over the past 20 years since the publication of the first reference
genome in 1999.  Ozan leads the foodborne enteric pathogen group at
the London school of hygiene and tropical medicine. Where they study
the physiology and pathogenesis of Campylobacter and other related
enteric microorganisms like Listeria and Vibrio. His background is in
Molecular Biology and Computer Science and he completed his PhD at
LSHTM (London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine) in 2011.
