Preprocessing sequence data before de novo assembly is a crucial step in enhancing the final quality of your assembly. This involves various techniques such as read trimming, correction, and filtering, which are collectively known as **Read Healing**.

## Key Steps in Read Healing

1. **Read Trimming**: Removing low-quality bases from the ends of reads to improve overall sequence quality.
2. **Correction**: Identifying and fixing sequencing errors that may have occurred during the sequencing process.
3. **Filtering**: Discarding reads that do not meet specific quality criteria to ensure that only high-quality data is used in the assembly process.

We also mentioned [PlasmidTron](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/plasmidtron), which can be found on GitHub under the Sanger Pathogens organization.

### Extra notes

**Key Points on Microbial Bioinformatics:**

- **Data Preprocessing and Quality Control:**
  - Tools such as *Trimomatic* are used to trim and preprocess Illumina and PacBio reads, respectively. *FastP* are other tools mentioned for improving read quality.
  - Challenges with data include low-quality bases and instrument errors, requiring smart trimming strategies like removing adapters and low-quality segments.
  - Read trimming strategies include determining cutoffs based on fixed quality scores (e.g., Q30) or average quality windows.
  - Overlapping reads can cause confusion for assemblers; techniques like merging overlapping reads to form singletons can improve assembly quality.

- **Advanced Read Processing Techniques:**
  - *Read healing* involves correction, trimming, and filtering of reads.
  - Read correction can be beneficial but risks eliminating minority variants and small plasmids, particularly in Illumina data.
  - Handling of PCR duplicates and k-mer distributions in data preprocessing can impact assembly outcomes. Techniques might involve deduplication or adjusting k-mer abundances.

- **Plasmid Handling and Analysis:**
  - Tools like *TipToft* and *PlasmidTron* are used to identify and analyze plasmids in sequencing data. They help manage challenges like plasmids being similar in copy numbers to chromosomes.
  - Using k-mer analysis to find unique sequences significant to specific conditions (e.g., disease) can be effective for plasmid detection.

- **Assembly Considerations:**
  - Subsampling data may lead to better assemblies by averting the assembly graph complexities associated with high coverage.
  - Attention to minor sequence variants and over-represented sequences helps maintain assembly quality without introducing biases.

These points highlight methodologies to handle sequencing data for quality and accuracy, address challenges in read correction and assembly, and understand the implications of plasmids within the context of genomic data analysis.
