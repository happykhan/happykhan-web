# Genotyping Techniques in the Pre-NGS Era

Genotyping has been a cornerstone of modern microbiology, enabling researchers to understand the genetic composition of organisms. Before the advent of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), several techniques were employed to analyze genetic variations. Below is a discussion of some of the primary methods used in the pre-NGS era:

## 1. **Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP)**

RFLP analysis involves the use of restriction enzymes to cut DNA at specific sequences, resulting in fragments of different lengths. These fragments are then separated by gel electrophoresis and visualized to identify genetic variations.

- **Pros:** Useful for mapping and DNA fingerprinting.
- **Cons:** Requires a relatively large amount of DNA and can be labor-intensive.

## 2. **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)**

PCR is a technique used to amplify a specific region of DNA, making it easier to study in detail. It laid the groundwork for various genotyping methods due to its ability to produce large quantities of DNA from small samples.

- **Pros:** Highly sensitive and efficient.
- **Cons:** Requires prior knowledge of the DNA sequence for primer design.

## 3. **Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)**

RAPD uses short, random primers to amplify DNA segments, resulting in a unique set of DNA markers that can be used for genotyping.

- **Pros:** Does not require detailed sequence information.
- **Cons:** Reproducibility can be an issue, influenced by PCR conditions.

## 4. **Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP)**

AFLP combines the principles of RFLP and PCR to detect DNA polymorphisms. It involves restriction enzyme digestion, ligation of adaptors, and selective PCR amplification of the fragments.

- **Pros:** High multiplex ratio; no prior sequence information needed.
- **Cons:** Technically complex and requires a significant amount of DNA.

## 5. **Microsatellite Analysis**

Microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are short tandemly repeated DNA sequences. Variations in the number of repeat units are used as genetic markers.

- **Pros:** High polymorphism and co-dominance.
- **Cons:** Development of markers is costly and time-consuming.

## 6. **Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Detection**

SNPs are single base pair variations in the genome. Various methods like allele-specific PCR and oligonucleotide arrays were developed for SNP genotyping.

- **Pros:** High abundance throughout the genome.
- **Cons:** Requires prior knowledge of the SNP location.

These methods were pivotal in advancing genetic analysis prior to the development of NGS technologies, which now offer more comprehensive and high-throughput solutions for studying organismal genomes. Each of the pre-NGS techniques has contributed immensely to our understanding of genetic variation and has paved the way for modern genomic research.

### Extra notes

- **Techniques for Microbial Profiling**: Discussed traditional methods such as plasma typing, phage typing, and serotyping based on morphological changes or susceptibilities. Genotyping methods such as Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE), Multiple-Locus Variable number tandem repeat Analysis (MLVA), and MultiLocus Sequence Typing (MLST) were also covered. These classical techniques have proven to be reliable and continue to be used in certain contexts like serotyping for Salmonella.

- **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)**: Highlighted the shift from older genomic techniques to NGS, with an emphasis on how technological advancements have improved genomic analysis and detection, particularly in epidemiology.

- **Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)**: Explored how WGS complements traditional methods by providing higher resolution data, enhancing outbreak tracking, and offering detailed insight into genomic diversity. WGS is gradually replacing older techniques like PFGE in many labs.

- **Challenges in Correlating Techniques**: Discussed the difficulty in correlating PFGE and WGS data. PFGE is not a one-to-one reflection of WGS results as restriction sites can be influenced by factors like methylation, impacting the consistency of banding patterns.

- **Integration with Surveillance Networks**: Mentioned the integration of whole genome data into databases such as NCBI for public access, respecting patient confidentiality through anonymization.

- **Communication and Data Sharing**: Emphasized the importance of data sharing globally to track microbial outbreaks, referencing how platforms like PulseNet and GenomeTracker facilitate international cooperation.

- **Genre Tracker and IRIDA**: Described GenomeTracker, an FDA initiative for WGS data sharing, and IRIDA, a Canadian project for managing infectious disease data and standardized workflows. These platforms support the wider use of bioinformatics in monitoring and outbreak investigations.

- **Tools and Systems**: Highlighted the use of platforms like Galaxy and IRIDA, which democratize bioinformatics by making it accessible to a wider audience. These systems allow for custom workflows and ease in data management.

- **Technical Community and Collaboration**: Discussed the importance of community-driven platforms such as Galaxy, which are used extensively across institutions globally, including at the University of Georgia and beyond. Galaxy provides a scalable and user-friendly interface for bioinformatics analysis.

- **Historical Context and Transition**: Reflected on the transition from traditional pathogen typing methods to more sophisticated genomic techniques, emphasizing the role of historical methods in shaping current practices.

Overall, the podcast underscores the evolving landscape of microbial bioinformatics, highlighting the balance between maintaining reliable classic techniques and adopting cutting-edge genomic technologies for more comprehensive microbial analysis and outbreak monitoring.
