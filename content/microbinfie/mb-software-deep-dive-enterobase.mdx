We chat with Nabil about EnteroBase, and learn about the background to
the project, the general benefits of the platforms and some of the
strange quirks users might encounter. EnteroBase is an integrated
software environment that supports the identification of global
population structures within several bacterial genera that include
pathogens.   Papers: Mentioned PLOS genetics paper: Alikhan et al.
(2018) A genomic overview of the population structure of Salmonella.

transmissions, Yersinia pestis phylogeny and Escherichia core genomic
diversity. Genome Res. 30:138-152.
