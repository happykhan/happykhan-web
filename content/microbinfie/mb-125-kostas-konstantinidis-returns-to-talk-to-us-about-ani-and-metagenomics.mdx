In this session, Kostas Konstantinidis returns to discuss two important topics in microbial bioinformatics: Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and metagenomics. 

**Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI)** is a valuable tool for comparing genomic sequences. It serves as a crucial metric for species delineation and understanding the genetic relationships between different microorganisms. ANI provides insights into microbial taxonomy and genetic diversity by measuring the similarity between pairs of DNA sequences.

**Metagenomics** involves the study of genetic material recovered directly from environmental samples. It enables the exploration of microbial communities without the need for cultivating individual species in the laboratory. This approach provides a comprehensive view of the biodiversity and functional potential of microbial ecosystems.

Kostas Konstantinidis's insights into ANI and metagenomics deepen our understanding of microbial communities and their genetic diversity. These techniques play a significant role in advancing microbial bioinformatics and offer promising applications in various scientific fields.

### Extra notes

* **Soil Metagenomics**: The field has transitioned from merely describing microbial diversity over the past two decades to understanding functional mechanisms, similar to human microbiome studies. Current focus areas include adaptation to climate change, agricultural practices, and potential manipulations to enhance soil functions like nitrogen retention.

* **Microbial Novelty**: There is significant unexplored microbial diversity in environments such as backyard gardens, with discoveries of novel genera and species regularly occurring through sequencing.

* **Technological Challenges**: One significant hurdle is the vast diversity in soil that requires extensive sequencing efforts. For example, achieving 99% coverage of soil DNA may necessitate sequencing at terabase levels. 

* **Long-read Sequencing**: Technologies like the Oxford Nanopore's MinION allow in-situ sampling and sequencing, enabling the capturing of live, fresh samples that prevent bacterial die-off due to freezing, leading to more accurate microbial community assessments.

* **Metagenomic Tools and Software**:
  * *Nonpareil*: A tool developed in 2013-2014 to gauge sequencing coverage of metagenomes, determining how much of the microbial DNA in a sample has been sequenced. It uses read redundancy to assess coverage.
  * Software development is driven by specific research needs when existing tools don't suffice. Nonpareil was created due to the absence of similar tools at the time.
  * The field contains numerous tools for metagenomic analysis, each with nuances that require researchers to choose based on their specific needs and data types.
  
* **Analyzing Microbial Communities**: Metagenomic projects seek to understand microbial responses to perturbations such as human gut infections or environmental disruptions like oil spills. Oil spills, for instance, led to the discovery of microbes that rapidly proliferate in the presence of oil, leading to potential biotechnological applications for bioremediation through biosurfactant production.

* **Horizontal Gene Transfer**: The podcast discusses the importance of understanding how rapidly genes, plasmids, and phages move between organisms in microbial communities, crucial for adaptation and microbial evolution studies.

* **Emerging Trends and Future Directions**:
  * Long-read technologies are set to revolutionize metagenomic studies by providing more complete genome assemblies, thus enhancing our understanding of microbial diversity and functions.
  * Hybrid assembly and binning tools are becoming more prevalent, combining strengths of different technologies for better genome reconstruction.
  * The pace of software development in the field is rapid, with numerous tools for various tasks, each with unique advantages and limitations.

* **Software and Data Handling**:
  * The need to update methods continually due to rapidly advancing sequencing technologies and the consequent large influx of data.
  * Curated databases like Swiss-Prot are often out-of-date compared to raw data repositories like GenBank, highlighting the importance of checking both for comprehensive data annotation. 

* **Practical Applications**: Beyond academic curiosity, understanding microbial functions can lead to practical applications like improving agricultural sustainability or developing new biotechnologies for environmental cleanup. 

* **Funding and Research Directions**: There is ongoing interest in growing the soil microbiome research field to the level of human microbiome studies, emphasizing the need for more funding to advance understanding and practical applications.
