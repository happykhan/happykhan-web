# The Gathering of MicroBinfies

For the first time ever, all three MicroBinfies are together in person to record an episode. Joining us is Torsten Seemann, and we dive into an engaging conversation about the challenges of translating research into public health applications. 

## Topics Covered

- **Research vs. Public Health**: We explore how our work in research can sometimes lose its intended impact when applied to public health contexts.
  
- **SARS-CoV-2 Genomics**: We discuss our experiences and contributions during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, delving into the genomics efforts that were made.

- **Geography and Language**: An unexpected twist in our conversation leads us to discuss the nuances of geography and language, and their roles in science communication.

We hope you enjoy this unique episode with all MicroBinfies present. Your feedback and thoughts are always welcome!

The guest speakers on the Microbial Bioinformatics podcast transcript include Dr. Nabil Ali Khan, Dr. Andrew Page, Dr. Lee Katz, and Torsen Seaman.
