# MicroBinfies Special Episode

**Episode Summary:**

For the first time ever, all three MicroBinfies are together in person to record an episode. Joined by Torsten Seemann, we engage in a captivating discussion about how research, particularly in the realm of public health, can sometimes get lost in translation. We delve into our work with *SARS-CoV-2* genomics and, somewhat unexpectedly, find ourselves chatting about geography and language. We hope you enjoy this special episode!

## Topics Discussed:

- **The Intersection of Research and Public Health:**
  - How scientific findings can lose their impact when translated into public health policy and practice.
  
- **SARS-CoV-2 Genomics:**
  - Our contributions and insights into the genomic study of *SARS-CoV-2* and its implications for understanding the pandemic.

- **Unexpected Tangents:**
  - An engaging exploration of geography and language, illustrating the diverse interests and serendipitous nature of scientific conversations.

## Special Guest:

**Torsten Seemann:** A renowned researcher with expertise in genomics, sharing valuable perspectives on translating scientific research into real-world applications.

*Thank you for listening, and we hope you find the episode both informative and enjoyable!*
