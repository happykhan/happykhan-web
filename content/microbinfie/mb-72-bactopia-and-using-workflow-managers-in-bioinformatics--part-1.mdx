# Interview with Dr. Robert Petit on Bactopia

We are joined by Dr. Robert Petit from the Wyoming Public Health Laboratory to discuss Bactopia, a bioinformatics workflow designed specifically for bacterial genomes.

## Useful Resources

- **Documentation:** [Bactopia Docs](https://bactopia.github.io/)
- **Repository:** [Bactopia GitHub](https://github.com/bactopia/bactopia/)
- **Publication:** [Bactopia mSystems Publication](https://doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.00190-20)

Dr. Petit provides valuable insights into how Bactopia can be utilized in bacterial genome research. For those interested, the above resources offer detailed documentation, the GitHub repository for accessing the workflow, and a pivotal publication in *mSystems* outlining the scientific background and application of Bactopia.

The speakers on the Microbinfeed podcast are Dr. Lee Katz, Dr. Nabil Ali Khan, Dr. Andrew Page, and guest speaker Robert Petit. Dr. Katz works at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and is an adjunct member at the University of Georgia in the US. Dr. Andrew Page and Dr. Nabil Ali Khan are from the Quadram Institute in Norwich, UK, focusing on microbes in food and their impact on human health. Robert Petit is the guest speaker discussing Bactopia, and he is currently working with the Wyoming Public Health Laboratory to help build bioinformatics infrastructure in response to SARS-CoV-2.
