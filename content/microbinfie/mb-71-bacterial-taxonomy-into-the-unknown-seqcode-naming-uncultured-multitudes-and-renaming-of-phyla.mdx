# Bacterial Taxonomy: New Approaches and Controversies

In our latest discussion on bacterial taxonomy, we explore the innovative methods for naming the multitude of unnamed, uncultured organisms as well as the contentious issue of renaming phyla. Our expert guests include:

- Professor Phil Hugenholtz
- Professor Iain Sutcliffe
- Professor Mark Pallen

## Overview

This discussion focuses on modern approaches in the taxonomy of bacteria, particularly on the challenges and methodologies involved in classifying unnamed and uncultured organisms. Additionally, we delve into the ongoing debate over the renaming of bacterial phyla, examining both the scientific and practical implications.
