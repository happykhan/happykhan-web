We are back talking about systematics, and SeqCode;  a nomenclatural code for prokaryotes described from sequence data. 
Marike Palmer is a  Postdoctoral researcher in the School of Life Sciences at the University of Nevada Las Vegas and Miguel Rodriguez is an Assistant Professor of Bioinformatics at the University of Innsbruck in the departments of Microbiology and the Digital Science Center (DiSC).

They discussed the SeqCode, a nomenclature code for Prokaryotes described from sequence data. The SeqCode was created to provide a specific nomenclature code for previously uncultivated organisms. Palmer explained that the impetus for the SeqCode was the need to accommodate previously uncultivated organisms under a specific nomenclature code. She emphasized that the SeqCode was written to allow any peer-reviewed publication, but noted that the authors have designed three paths of validation in the SeqCode. They hope that anyone proposing a name will work with the curriculum team to ensure the best quality descriptions, names, etymology, and solidification. 

Rodriguez discussed the SeqCode's governance, which is already in place, and they have made them public so that anyone interested can join the SeqCode community. The governance structure comprises an executive board, committees, and working groups. The position's co-opted members hold some of the committees of these committees, while some are chosen by ballot.

The hosts sought to clarify the relationship between the Isme Society, which is backing the SeqCode, and the wider field in general. Rodriguez explained that ISME is simply providing support as an umbrella organization for the SeqCode. 

Palmer and Rodriguez clarified that the SeqCode is not a competing code but rather a parallel one that aims to accommodate previously uncultivated organisms. The SeqCode was created to provide a specific nomenclature code for previously uncultivated organisms. Palmer noted that most scientists culture prokaryotes not for naming but to advance their knowledge of these organisms through physiology experiments. They emphasized that the new system is the result of a long collaborative effort that involved many different viewpoints and philosophies.

The episode also discussed the practical requirements for naming under the new system, which include standards for the completeness and contamination levels required in the genome sequence data. Palmer noted that while the 16S rRNA gene sequence was not required for naming, it was recommended for improved accuracy in cross-talk between different taxonomies. The conversation highlighted the importance and challenges of naming microorganisms and the ongoing efforts to create a system that is inclusive of all microorganisms, both cultivated and uncultivated.

Rodriguez and Palmer also discussed the SeqCode, a nature code for naming prokaryotes described from sequence data. They agreed that high-quality genomes should be the main control types to ensure the system builds up rather than breaks down. They noted the challenge of obtaining full genomes of some organisms, such as obligate intracellular parasites but suggested obtaining housekeeping genes as a potential solution. They further explained the technical issue of estimating completeness or contamination for many taxa, but Palmer confirmed that registering a name on the SeqCode registry requires adding such estimates. 

It emphasized the importance of collaboration within the scientific community and the need to create a system that is inclusive of all microorganisms. It also highlighted the challenges inherent in the process of naming microorganisms but demonstrated that it is an ongoing process, and that scientists are working to create a system that is accurate, practical, and beneficial for all.
