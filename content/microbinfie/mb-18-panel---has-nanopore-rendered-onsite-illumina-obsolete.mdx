# Panel Discussion at MRC Gambia: Emerging Infectious Diseases

In January 2020, a panel discussion was held at the MRC Gambia at The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The event occurred in front of a live audience of scientists during a period when SARS-CoV-2 was beginning to be reported as an emerging infectious disease.

## Panelists

- **Andrew Page** - Quadram Institute
- **David Baker** - Quadram Institute
- **Ozan Gundogdu** - London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (UK)
- **Abdul Sesay** - London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (Gambia)
- **Nick Loman** - University of Birmingham (Joined via Skype)
  
The discussion was chaired by:

- **Suzie Hingley-Wilson** - University of Surrey

## Audience Interaction

The session included questions, discussions, and comments from:

- **Mark Pallen** - Quadram Institute
- **Muna Anjum** - Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA)
- **Arnoud van Vliet** - University of Surrey
- **Martin Antonio** - London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine
- **Archie Worwui** - London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine

Unfortunately, the audio recording did not capture contributions from Nick Loman due to his remote participation via Skype, although his input was notably valuable.

### Extra notes

- **Future of Sequencing Platforms**:
  - Debate over whether Illumina sequencing is becoming obsolete with the rise of Nanopore sequencing.
  - Advantages of Nanopore long-read sequencing include greater data insights from metagenomics and biologically interesting information compared to short-read sequencing.

- **Technical Challenges of Nanopore Sequencing**:
  - Error rates in Nanopore sequencing remain a concern, affecting SNP resolution.
  - Continuous advancements in methodologies aiming to mitigate error rates in Nanopore.
  - Importance of addressing these errors for high-level applications like outbreak tracking and antimicrobial resistance investigations.

- **Application and Methodologies**:
  - Discussion on the hybrid use of sequencing platforms to combine Nanopore with Illumina or PacBio for comprehensive analysis.
  - Potential for Nanopore to be used for outbreak detection, with Illumina or high-quality reads for finer resolution when necessary.

- **Data Processing and Bioinformatics Pipelines**:
  - Need for distinct bioinformatics pipelines for Nanopore due to differing error characteristics compared to Illumina.
  - Issues with Nanopore data involving frequent updates in base-calling software, requiring regular recalibration of data.

- **Practical and Logistical Considerations**:
  - Comparing costs and accessibility of sequencing technologies, noting that Nanopore offers a lower barrier to entry compared to larger Illumina or PacBio setups.
  - Implications of sequencing platform choice on logistics and infrastructure, particularly in resource-limited settings.

- **Bioinformatics Community Perspectives**:
  - Diverse opinions on the suitability and future direction of sequencing technologies within varied research contexts (e.g., African vs. high-income countries).
  - Considerations around data rights, ethics, and in-country sequencing capabilities with emerging technologies.

- **Current and Future Developments**:
  - Illumina still viewed as crucial for a small percentage of applications requiring high-quality reads.
  - Potential of a comprehensive solution from technologies like PacBio to bridge quality and length capabilities, though cost remains a concern.
