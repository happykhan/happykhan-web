# What's Next for Nextstrain?

**Author:** Microbial Bioinformatics  
**Article Number:** 86

Nextstrain is an innovative tool in the field of microbial bioinformatics that tracks and visualizes pathogen evolution. As the platform evolves, there are several exciting developments and future directions to look forward to. Here are some potential pathways for Nextstrain's growth:

## 1. Expanding Pathogen Coverage

Nextstrain initially gained attention for its work on pathogens like **_Influenza virus_** and **_Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)_**. Future expansions may include tracking additional pathogens, providing a comprehensive tool for global pathogen surveillance.

## 2. Enhanced Data Integration

Integrating more diverse data sources, such as **genomic sequences**, **epidemiological data**, and **clinical outcomes**, could enhance the platform's ability to predict and visualize disease dynamics more accurately.

## 3. Real-time Data Processing

Improving the platform's capacity to process data in real-time will further enhance its utility during outbreaks, enabling public health officials to make informed decisions based on the latest information.

## 4. User Interface Improvements

Streamlining and improving the user interface can make Nextstrain more accessible to non-experts, thus broadening the range of individuals who can benefit from its insights.

## 5. Community Engagement and Collaboration

Engaging with the scientific community through collaborations and the sharing of open-source tools and datasets can foster innovation and contribute to the platform's evolution.

## 6. Advances in Visualization Techniques

Nextstrain may incorporate advanced visualization methods to present data more dynamically and interactively, improving comprehension and analysis of complex datasets.

## Conclusion

Nextstrain is poised to remain a vital tool in microbial bioinformatics, with numerous potential enhancements that will expand its capabilities and impact. By embracing these future directions, Nextstrain can continue to support global efforts in understanding and combating infectious diseases.
