# Presentation by Sam Sheppard on Genomics in Epidemics

### Event
- **Workshop:** ARTICnetwork & CLIMB-BIG-DATA Workshop  
- **Topic:** COVID-19 Data Analysis  
- **Presenter:** Sam Sheppard, University of Bath  

### Overview
Sam Sheppard's presentation focused on the significant role of genomics in understanding and managing epidemics, particularly in the context of COVID-19. The session covered critical areas including:

- **Importance of Genomics:**  
  Sheppard highlighted the reasons why genomics is a valuable tool in epidemic scenarios. Its potential to provide detailed insights into the virus' structure, mutation rates, and transmission patterns can drastically improve epidemic response strategies.

- **Background on Typing Schemes:**  
  Discussed various typing schemes and how they are implemented in genomic studies, providing a framework for comparing and categorizing microorganisms.

- **Sequencing Methods:**  
  Introduced different methods of sequencing, comparing their efficiencies, accuracies, and applications. The talk emphasized the rapid evolution and availability of sequencing technologies.

- **Challenges in Genomic Data Analysis:**  
  Addressed the primary challenges faced when analyzing large volumes of genomic data, such as processing capacity, data storage, and the need for comprehensive bioinformatics tools.

### Extra notes

- **Microbial Bioinformatics Challenges and Goals**
  - The primary goal of clinical microbiology is identifying the pathogen causing an infection, including distinguishing between commensal organisms and pathogenic strains.
  - Differentiating between "good" and "bad" strains of a pathogen is crucial for understanding and managing infections.

- **Evolution of Strain Typing**
  - Various typing methodologies have been developed over the years, including serotyping, phage typing, and DNA-based profiling methods like restriction fragment length polymorphism and multi-locus sequence typing.
  - The resolution of typing methods is pivotal in distinguishing closely related strains.

- **The Shift to Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS)**
  - Due to decreased sequencing costs, WGS has become the preferred method for typing, as opposed to older techniques.
  - WGS enables more detailed genomic epidemiology by comparing entire pathogen genomes.

- **Technological Developments in Sequencing**
  - There is a move from centralized sequencing facilities to portable and community-based sequencing technologies.
  - The Illumina platform, particularly MiSeq, is widespread in labs globally.
  - Oxford Nanopore's portable devices allow sequencing in diverse and remote locations, useful for outbreak management.

- **Genomic Epidemiology and Data Sharing**
  - The advancement of genome sequencing facilitates better data sharing and standardization, unlike complex gel-based data.
  - Shared data through open-access databases enhances collaborative research and understanding of pathogen genomics.

- **Challenges in Data Utilization**
  - There are still significant challenges in managing, analyzing, and interpreting vast amounts of genomic data.
  - Initiatives like Climb support data handling and analysis across institutions, promoting collaborative research.

- **Applications of Genomic Epidemiology**
  - WGS allows researchers to track pathogen transmission, understand epidemiological links, and form hypotheses about strain emergence and spread.
  - These insights can inform public health responses and improve outbreak management strategies.
