In this episode of the microbinfie podcast, Sam Sheppard explores the evolution of molecular epidemiology, highlighting how genomic technologies have transformed our understanding of pathogen strain identification and outbreak tracking.

**Presenter:** Sam Sheppard, University of Bath  
**Event:** ARTICnetwork & CLIMB-BIG-DATA Workshop on COVID-19 Data Analysis

### Key Points

- **Use of Genomics in Epidemics:**  
  Sam Sheppard discussed the importance of integrating genomics in the study and management of epidemics, focusing on its application in understanding COVID-19.

- **Background on Typing Schemes:**  
  He provided an overview of different typing schemes that can be used for bacterial and viral pathogens and their relevance in tracking the spread of diseases.

- **Sequencing Methods:**  
  The presentation covered various sequencing techniques, highlighting their benefits and constraints, and how these can be applied to study pathogens at a genomic level.

- **Challenges in Genomic Data Analysis:**  
  Sheppard addressed the issues faced while analyzing large volumes of genomic data. This includes data storage, computational requirements, and the complexity of interpreting results.

### Resources

- [Sheppard Lab Website](https://sheppardlab.com/)
- [ARTIC and CLIMB-BIG-DATA Joint Workshop](https://www.climb.ac.uk/artic-and-climb-big-data-joint-workshop/)

These resources offer further insights into the applications of genomics in monitoring and controlling emerging infectious diseases.

### Extra notes

- **Microbial Typing and Strain Differentiation:**
  - The podcast discusses various methodologies for distinguishing between microbial strains, emphasizing the need to differentiate pathogenic strains from commensal organisms.
  - Traditional typing techniques include serotyping, phage typing, *restriction fragment length polymorphism* (RFLP), and *pulse-field gel electrophoresis* (PFGE).
  - *Multi-locus sequence typing* (MLST) is highlighted as a method where usually seven genes are sequenced to differentiate between strains.

- **Evolution of Typing Approaches:**
  - The transition from older methods to genomic epidemiology has been driven by decreasing sequencing costs, making whole-genome sequencing the preferred approach for typing and tracking pathogen strains.

- **Current Sequencing Technologies:**
  - The use of *Illumina* sequencing platforms, particularly the *MiSeq*, is commonplace in many laboratories, enabling more accessible genomic sequencing and data sharing across labs.
  - The podcast notes the "democratization" and "mobilization" of sequencing with the advent of portable Oxford *Nanopore* sequencers, facilitating in-field or small-space laboratory sequencing operations.

- **Challenges and Collaboration:**
  - The complexity of analyzing and interpreting vast amounts of genome data represents a significant challenge.
  - The podcast mentions collaborative efforts, such as the *Climb* platform, which offer shared computational resources and support for managing large genomic datasets.

- **Data Sharing and Standardization:**
  - Genome sequencing allows for easier data sharing between laboratories globally, facilitated by open-access databases.
  - The importance of standardized analyses for comparative genomic epidemiology was emphasized.

- **Applications in Molecular Epidemiology:**
  - Genomic epidemiology aids in understanding the relationships between strains, tracking outbreaks, and hypothesizing about pathogen evolution.
  - Insights gained can be applied to comprehend the transmission and emergence of new strains, including those related to significant pathogens like coronaviruses.

- **Technical and Analytical Infrastructure:**
  - The session discusses advancements in data infrastructure and computational power, enabling the use of genomic epidemiology to map the spread and evolution of pathogens with greater accuracy.
