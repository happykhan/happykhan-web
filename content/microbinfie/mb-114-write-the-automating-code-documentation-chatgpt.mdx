title: 'Episode 114: Write-the: Automating Code Documentation ChatGPT'
transcript: /microbinfie-transcripts/episode-114.txt
---

In this episode, we dive deep into the world of automated code documentation and conversion using ChatGPT, powered by the *Write-the* software developed by Dr. Wytamma Wirth from the University of Melbourne. Our guest, an experienced software engineer, guides us through the challenges and nuances of writing code documentation and the role AI can play in streamlining this process.

We explore the intersection of ChatGPT's capabilities with *Write the Docs*, a widely-used documentation system by developers. From showcasing ChatGPT's ability to understand and generate code snippets, to demonstrating real-time code conversion across multiple programming languages, this episode is a valuable resource for developers looking to enhance their workflow. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, tune in to discover how the synergy of AI and coding can elevate your documentation game to the next level!
