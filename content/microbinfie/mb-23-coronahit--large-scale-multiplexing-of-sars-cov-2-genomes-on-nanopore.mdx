# Interview with the Authors of CoronaHiT

In this engaging discussion, we chat with the authors behind *CoronaHiT*, an innovative method that allows for sequencing up to 94 *SARS-CoV-2* samples on a single MinION flowcell. This approach significantly reduces sequencing costs by three-fold and employs a simpler, faster protocol.

## Guests

- **Justin O'Grady**
- **David Baker**

Hosted by:

- **Andrew Page**
- **Nabil-Fareed Alikhan**

## Topics Covered

- The workings of *CoronaHiT*
- The development process behind this method
- Reasons why *CoronaHiT* is a game changer in the field
