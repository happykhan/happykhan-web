# Final Episode with Titus Brown: Scaling Metagenomic Search with Sourmash

In this final episode, the conversation with Titus Brown delves into his work on scaling metagenomic search with **Sourmash**. Below is an overview of the topics covered:

## Overview of Sourmash
- **Functionality**: Sourmash is designed for sketching and comparing large k-mer datasets.
- **Sampling Approach**: Enables analyses such as containment estimation.

## Exciting Capabilities
- **Branchwater Tool**: Features for multi-threaded real-time SRA search.
- **Scalability**: Ability to search across millions of metagenomes in seconds using WebAssembly.

## Applications and Implications
- **Public Health**: Potential applications in tracking and sourcing pathogens.
- **Caveats and Limitations**: 
  - Resolution limits.
  - Need for follow-up analyses.
  - Ongoing work to characterize specificity and sensitivity.

## Emphasizing Precision
- Titus highlights the necessity of accurately communicating the capabilities and limitations of bioinformatic tools as research progresses.
