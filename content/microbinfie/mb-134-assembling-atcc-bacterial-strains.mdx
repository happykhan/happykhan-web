In this episode of the Micro Binfie podcast, host Andrew Page is
joined by Nikhita Puthuveetil, Senior Bioinformatician at the American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC). They delve into ATCC's ambitious
project of sequencing a vast array of organisms from their renowned
collection, tackling the challenges of assembling complex genomes from
bacteria, viruses, fungi, and more. Discover how Nikhita and her team
navigate through genomic roadblocks, leverage cutting-edge sequencing
technologies, and work to ensure accurate data provenance. Whether
it's large viral genomes or evolving taxonomy, this episode offers a
deep dive into the fascinating world of microbial bioinformatics and
genomic curation.
