# Recent Updates on SARS-CoV-2 Resources

Stay up-to-date with the latest bioinformatics and genomics tools for SARS-CoV-2 research. Below are some valuable resources and tools to help you navigate ongoing developments in the field, as of 5 February 2021.

## Key Resources

- **CoVariants Website**: Explore different variants of SARS-CoV-2 through this dedicated platform. Visit [CoVariants.org](http://covariants.org/).

- **Microreact**: Visualize and share genomic data easily with the interactive Microreact platform. Check out the COG Consortium project at [Microreact](https://microreact.org/project/cogconsortium/).

- **Lineage Reports**: Stay informed with the latest updates on SARS-CoV-2 lineages by visiting [cov-lineages.org](https://cov-lineages.org/).

- **CLIMB ARTIC Workshop**: Access online resources from the CLIMB ARTIC and Big Data Joint Workshop at [CLIMB](https://www.climb.ac.uk/artic-and-climb-big-data-joint-workshop/).

- **Multiplex PCR for Variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1**: Find protocols for Multiplexed RT-qPCR to detect these SARS-CoV-2 variants on [Protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/view/multiplexed-rt-qpcr-to-screen-for-sars-cov-2-b-1-1-brrhm536).

- **CDC Videos**: Gain insights through educational videos from the CDC's COVID-19 Genomic Epidemiology Toolkit. Access them on the [CDC's official site](https://www.cdc.gov/amd/training/covid-19-gen-epi-toolkit.html).

These resources should help you stay informed and equipped to handle the fast-paced developments in SARS-CoV-2 genomics and bioinformatics. Keep exploring and learning!

### Extra notes

- There has been a significant focus on analyzing SARS-CoV-2 variants, with new resources and tools being developed for tracking and understanding these variants.

- **Covariance.org**: A website cataloging different SARS-CoV-2 variants and their mutations, detailing potential impacts like changes in antibody recognition or spike protein structure. It aggregates data from contributors like the Nextstrain group and GISAID, helping identify and understand variants quickly.

- **Microreact**: A visualization tool for genomic data, particularly useful for tracking SARS-CoV-2 lineages. The tool has been updated to display the frequency of lineages as a proportion of total samples, providing clearer insights. It integrates real-time data from sources like COG-UK.

- Challenges highlighted include data sharing concerns and sequencing biases, where particular regions might seem more affected due to higher sequencing rates rather than actual spread.

- The **Pangolin** and **Civet** tools, developed by prominent SARS-CoV-2 researchers, are essential resources for genomic lineage assignment, while **GISAID** has launched a CLI/API submission tool for faster genomic data submissions.

- Community-driven efforts are essential, with resources like the **Clam Arctic Workshop** providing educational materials and workshops to build competencies in analyzing genomic data. 

- The podcast mentions the potential adaptation of RT-qPCR methods to focus on specific mutations of concern rather than entire lineages, acknowledging a dynamic approach as variant landscapes evolve.

- Prominent researchers like Josh Quick and Nick Loman are actively contributing to developing tools and methodologies for better understanding and responding to the pandemic through genomic epidemiology.

- There is recognition of the need for training resources and workshops to keep pace with the rapidly evolving situation, helping ensure public health responses are informed by the latest genomic data.

- Lastly, Denmark is cited as a leading example in scaling up genome sequencing efforts, showing that rapid genomic data collection and analysis are possible with adequate infrastructure and support.
