### Extra notes

- **Neisseria Genus**: Discussed the genetic flexibility of Neisseria bacteria, highlighting their ability to absorb DNA from other bacteria and recombine frequently, making them a fascinating subject for study in public health.
  
- **Listeria and Cancer Therapy**: Listeria's intracellular infection capability is being harnessed by pharmaceutical companies to present cancer antigens, potentially offering a novel cancer vaccination strategy.

- **Microbes in Food Production**: Emphasized the essential role of microbes in producing foods like bread, beer, yogurt, and even chocolate, which involves a fermentation process.

- **Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT)**: Discussed as a treatment for C. difficile infections with the mystery surrounding which specific microbes are beneficial. There remains a lack of understanding about its mechanism despite its efficacy.

- **Sequencing and Bioinformatics**: Covered personal experiences with genome sequencing, including early genome projects and analyzing pathogens through bioinformatic techniques.
  
- **Microbial and Pathogen Genomics**: Highlights from careers that shifted into microbial genomics, emphasizing its ongoing challenge and potential significant public health impact.

- **Misconceptions in Microbiology**: Addressed the stereotype of microbiologists wearing white lab coats, indicating that bioinformaticians usually work with more casual or practical wear in reality.

- **Technical Tools and Analysis**: Mentioned tools and methodologies in microbial bioinformatics, such as GFF files and BAM files, with insights that frequent exposure can lead to pattern recognition skills.

- **Interdisciplinary Pathways**: Personal narratives showcased how diverse academic and career backgrounds converge in microbial bioinformatics, from computer science to genomics infrastructure.

- **Challenges in Bioinformatics**: Highlighted challenges like the lack of data understanding in fecal microbiota treatment and the evolving nature of bioinformatic techniques and tools.
