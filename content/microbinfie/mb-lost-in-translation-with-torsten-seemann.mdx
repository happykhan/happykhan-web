For the first time ever all 3 MicroBinfies are together in person to
record an episode. We are joined by Torsten Seemann for a conversation
about how what we do in research can get lost in translation when
applied to public health. We discuss what we did with SARS-CoV-2
genomics and somehow end up chatting about geography and language.
Hope you enjoy.
