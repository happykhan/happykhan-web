In this episode of the Podcast, hosts Lee Katz and Andrew Page delve into the intricacies of clinical metagenomics. Joined by experts Torsten Seemann and Finlay Maguire, they explore the challenges and methodologies involved in identifying pathogens in clinical samples when traditional diagnostic methods fail. They discuss the types of samples analyzed, the impact of low DNA concentrations, and the complexities of sequencing data interpretation. The conversation highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between bioinformaticians and clinicians in managing difficult infections. Despite the hurdles, clinical metagenomics is presented as a complementary tool aiding in diagnosis, emphasizing the need for genomic literacy among healthcare professionals.
