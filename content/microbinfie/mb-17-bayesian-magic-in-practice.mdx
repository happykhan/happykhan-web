Join Dr. Conor Meehan, Dr. Leo Martins, and Dr. Nabil-Fareed Alikhan as they delve deeper into the fascinating realm of Bayesian methodologies. This part of the series continues the exploration of the **Bayesian** approach in various fields, shedding light on its applications and intricacies.

## Guests

## Some notes
- **Bayesian Models**: 
  - Not a philosophy or religion, but a class of models based on conditional probabilities.
  - Integrate various data sources for phylogenetic analysis.
  
- **Key Concept**:
  - Bayes' Theorem: The probability of a model given the data equals the probability of the data given the model multiplied by the prior probability of the model.
  
- **Priors and Posteriors**:
  - **Prior**: Initial belief about parameters before observing data.
  - **Posterior**: Updated belief after incorporating data.

### **Getting Started with Bayesian Inference**
- **Tools**:
  - **Rev**: Recommended for beginners; simple tutorials available.
  - **STAN**: Known for graphical models and flowcharts to describe interactions.
  
- **Resources**:
  - **Taming the Beast**: An online course with tutorials for various skill levels.

### **Building Bayesian Methods into Existing Work**
- **Collaboration**: Encouraged to consult statisticians for guidance and validation.
- **Simulation Techniques**:
  - **Simulated Annealing**: Optimization technique for Bayesian models.
  - **Approximate Bayesian Computing (ABC)**: Simulates data to approximate posterior distributions.

### **Interpreting Results**
- **Convergence Checking**: Essential to ensure analysis is complete.
  - Tools: 
    - **Tracer**: Commonly used for visualizing convergence.
    - **RWTY**: Computes distances between trees and checks convergence.
  
- **Estimates**:
  - Most common output is the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) tree.
  - Programs like **Big Tree** help in visualizing uncertainties.

### **Popular Bayesian Software in Phylogenetics**
- **BEAST**: 
  - Well-known for creating time trees with a user-friendly interface.
  - Comes with tools for post-processing and analyzing convergence.
  
- **MrBayes and RevBayes**: 
  - MrBayes is no longer supported; RevBayes is the recommended alternative.
  
- **Comparative Tools**:
  - **LSD**: For creating time trees from maximum likelihood trees.

### **Models in Bayesian Inference**
- Bayesian models are used extensively for phylogenetic analysis, but they require careful consideration of priors and data inputs.
- Understanding the differences between model outputs in Bayesian vs. maximum likelihood frameworks is crucial.

Bayesian inference in microbial bioinformatics allows for complex modeling and integration of various data sources, offering a robust framework for understanding evolutionary relationships among pathogens.
