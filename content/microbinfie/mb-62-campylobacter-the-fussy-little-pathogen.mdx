Our guest today is Dr Ozan Gundogdu and he gives us a crash course in
food borne pathogen Campylobacter. If you've ever had a dodgy tummy
after eating undercooked chicken, Campy is probably the cause.  Ozan
leads the foodborne enteric pathogen group at the London school of
hygiene and tropical medicine. Where they study the physiology and
pathogenesis of Campylobacter and other related enteric microorganisms
like Listeria and Vibrio.  His background is in Molecular Biology and
Computer Science and he completed his PhD at LSHTM (London School of
Hygiene & Tropical Medicine) in 2011.
