# Podcast Takeover: Canadians in the Spotlight!

Join guest host **Dr. Emma Griffiths** as she leads an exciting episode featuring a discussion with **Dr. Finn McGuire** and **Dr. William Hsiao**. This episode delves into the fascinating world of SARS-CoV-2 genomics epidemiology efforts in Canada.

For more information on these efforts, visit the [Cancogen website](https://www.genomecanada.ca/en/cancogen).

Tune in for expert insights and discussions on the cutting-edge science driving Canada’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Extra notes

- **Metadata Management and Challenges**: The podcast discusses the complexities of managing metadata in microbial bioinformatics, highlighting the harmonization of metadata for analysis within the National Genomic Surveillance Database. It points out the difficulty in sharing metadata due to privacy concerns and logistical challenges. 

- **CanCoGen Metadata Management Plan**: 
  - Metadata is divided into three tiers: low-risk de-identified data, middle-tier metadata for surveillance, and local identifiable metadata.
  - The negotiation of a minimal metadata standard took months due to differing provincial definitions of non-identifiable information. Legal experts were consulted to address these disparities.

- **Data Harmonization Tools**: 
  - The Data Harmonizer tool was developed to standardize metadata collection and validate data formats. It includes export functions compatible with public repositories and national lab reporting.
  - Emma leads a curation team to manually clean and harmonize incompatible data, ensuring high-quality metadata.

- **Challenges in Data Sharing**: 
  - Canada faces criticism for slow data sharing with public repositories, partly due to fragmented provincial privacy laws and the different interpretations of these laws by provincial privacy officers.
  - The COVID-19 response highlighted these challenges, with provinces varying in their willingness to share complete metadata.

- **Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology (PHAGE)**: 
  - The PHAGE consortium has established standards for SARS-CoV-2 sampling metadata, involving consultations with researchers and public health stakeholders to adapt and enhance the standards.

- **Improving Data Sharing Practices**:
  - The discussion identifies the need for a centralized, well-connected decentralized healthcare system to facilitate data sharing and enhance genomic epidemiology use, similar to efforts seen in the UK.
  - There is emphasis on the importance of robust QC metrics and centralized genomic checks for effective data use.

- **Trust-Building and Governance**:
  - Building trust within the public health system is crucial. There's a focus on overcoming the barriers to consensus in data sharing across Canada and improving the legal, ethical, and governance frameworks.

- **Advice for Decentralized Systems**:
  - For countries with decentralized health systems, centralizing data collection and curation is advised. Establishing central data repositories and shared analytical platforms can enhance system performance.
