In this episode of the Micro Binfie Podcast, host Andrew Page speaks with Dr. Brooke Talbot, a recent PhD graduate from Emory University, about her research on Staphylococcus aureus, with a focus on MRSA and antibiotic resistance. Brooke shares insights into her molecular epidemiology work, discussing the complexities of tracking resistant bacterial strains in clinical settings and the significance of genomic epidemiology in public health. From honeybees to foodborne outbreaks, Brooke’s diverse research background offers listeners a fascinating journey through science, microbiology, and epidemiology.
