In this episode of the Micro Binfie Podcast, host Andrew Page speaks with Dr. Brooke Talbot, a recent PhD graduate from Emory University, about her research on Staphylococcus aureus, with a focus on MRSA and antibiotic resistance. 

Brooke shares insights into her molecular epidemiology work, discussing the complexities of tracking resistant bacterial strains in clinical settings and the significance of genomic epidemiology in public health. From honeybees to foodborne outbreaks, Brooke’s diverse research background offers listeners a fascinating journey through science, microbiology, and epidemiology.

### Key Points

#### 1. Research Focus on Staphylococcus aureus
- Investigated molecular epidemiology of MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus)
- Explored USA 300 lineage and its emergence in the United States
- Studied genomic approaches to track bacterial strain evolution

#### 2. Antibiotic Resistance Dynamics
- Examined horizontal and de novo mutations in bacterial resistance
- Analyzed recurrence of bloodstream infections using genomic comparisons
- Highlighted challenges of tracking resistant bacterial strains

#### 3. Interdisciplinary Research Background
- Started with honeybee virus research
- Worked in public health, focusing on foodborne illness surveillance
- Utilized genomic epidemiology in public health practice

### Take-Home Messages
- Antibiotic resistance represents a complex and evolving public health challenge
- Genomic approaches provide powerful tools for tracking bacterial evolution
- Interdisciplinary research can lead to innovative scientific insights
