## Prof Mark Pallen on High-Throughput Microbial Genomics

We are joined again by Prof. Mark Pallen as he discusses his early experiences in high-throughput microbial genomics. Mark was delighted to have persuaded Nick Loman to join him in Birmingham. Together, they collaborated with George Weinstock to perform the first genome sequence analyses of Gram-negatives for genomic epidemiology, focusing on multi-drug resistant *Acinetobacter baumannii*.

After winning an Ion Torrent sequencer in a competition, Mark and Nick contributed pioneering genomic analyses of the German *STEC* outbreak. One of their studies involved crowdsourced approaches, facilitated by Twitter, and was published in the *New England Journal of Medicine*. The other study provided a performance comparison of newly launched benchtop sequencing platforms. Mark, Lee, and Nabil discuss how this outbreak challenged existing dogmas concerning the archetypal status of pathotypes of *E. coli*.

The conversation then shifts to the importance of evidence trails and challenging assumptions, whether in annotating proteins or quoting Darwin (see [Darwin on the Floor](https://colinpurrington.com/2012/02/darwin-on-the-floor-lhao/)). Nabil recalls the excitement of real-time analysis during an epidemic and acknowledges the legacy of Mark and Nick's work in 2011 to current approaches in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Mark describes his exciting ventures in exploiting metagenomics in clinical and ancient DNA contexts, including analysis of disease-associated stool samples and 200-year-old TB genomes in Hungarian mummies. This research overturned assumptions, showing that multiple infections with *M. tuberculosis* were common 200 years ago.

Shortly afterward, Pallen helped assemble a team to analyze undersea sediments, shedding light on the Neolithic transition in England, culminating in a paper in *Science*. Mark then discusses his recent metagenomics analyses of critically ill patients and the chicken gut, emphasizing the discovery of hundreds of new species in such commonplace settings.

Mark concludes by sharing his excitement about the vast expanse of the microbial world yet to be discovered through sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, suggesting that we are only 2% of the way there!
