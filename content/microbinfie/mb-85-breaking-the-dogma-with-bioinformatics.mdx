# Interview with Prof. Mark Pallen: Early Experiences in Microbial Genomics

We are pleased to be joined again by Prof. Mark Pallen, who shares with us his early experiences in high-throughput microbial genomics. 

## Collaboration with Nick Loman

Mark expresses his satisfaction in persuading Nick Loman to join him in Birmingham, where together, they collaborated with George Weinstock. This partnership led to the pioneering genome sequence analyses of Gram-negative bacteria, focusing on the genomic epidemiology of multi-drug resistant *Acinetobacter baumannii*.

## Breakthroughs in Genomic Analysis

After winning an Ion Torrent sequencer in a competition, Mark and Nick made significant contributions to the genomic analysis of the German STEC outbreak. Their initiatives included:

- A **crowdsourced study**, inspired by Twitter, which was published in the *New England Journal of Medicine*.
- A **performance comparison** of newly launched benchtop sequencing platforms.

Through their work, they challenged established notions regarding the archetypal status of E. coli pathotypes.

## The Need for Evidence and Challenging Assumptions

Mark, Lee, and Nabil emphasize the importance of maintaining evidence trails and questioning assumptions, whether in protein annotation or even in quoting figures like Darwin ([source](https://colinpurrington.com/2012/02/darwin-on-the-floor-lhao/)). Nabil reflects on the thrill of real-time epidemic analysis and recognizes how Mark and Nick's 2011 work informs current strategies addressing the Covid pandemic.

## Metagenomics and Ancient DNA

Mark describes his exciting ventures into metagenomics in both clinical and ancient DNA contexts. Key projects include:

- Analyzing disease-associated stool samples.
- Investigating 200-year-old TB genomes found in Hungarian mummies, uncovering that multiple infections by *M. tuberculosis* strains were common two centuries ago.

## Scientific Exploration

Following these endeavors, Pallen assembled a team to analyze undersea sediments, providing insights into the Neolithic transition in England, which led to a publication in *Science*. His recent metagenomics analyses span critically ill patients and the chicken gut, revealing the discovery of hundreds of new species in everyday environments.

## Future of Microbial Discovery

Mark concludes by expressing his enthusiasm for the vast, uncharted microbial world awaiting discovery through sequencing and bioinformatics. Remarkably, we are just 2% of the way there!

Mark's journey highlights the impactful role of genomics in challenging established scientific paradigms and the endless potential of microbial exploration.

The speakers on the Microbial Bioinformatics podcast include Dr. Lee Katz, Dr. Nabil Ali Khan, and Dr. Andrew Page as hosts. Their guest speaker is Professor Mark Palin, a Professor of Microbial Genomics at the University of East Anglia and a Research Leader at the Quadram Institute.
