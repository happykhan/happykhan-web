# 87 Nextstrain, SARS-CoV-2, and Dealing with a Data Deluge

**Microbial Bioinformatics**

The global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has initiated a massive influx of data, requiring robust tools to analyze and interpret these datasets effectively. Nextstrain, an open-source project, provides a powerful platform for tracking pathogen evolution in real-time, harnessing data deluge from SARS-CoV-2 to deliver insights into viral transmission and mutation.

## Key Topics

- **Nextstrain**: This platform integrates data from various genomic sources to visualize pathogen spread. It helps researchers and public health officials understand the dynamics of virus mutations and plan interventions accordingly.

- ***SARS-CoV-2***: The novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Studying its genome is crucial for developing treatment strategies and vaccines.

- **Data Deluge**: With the pandemic's rapid spread, there is an unprecedented amount of genomic data being generated. Efficiently managing and analyzing this data is essential for timely responses and research.

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Volume of Data**: As sequencing technology advances, the sheer volume of data continues to grow. Platforms like Nextstrain help by offering visualization and analytical tools.

2. **Data Integration**: Combining datasets from different sources can provide comprehensive insights. Nextstrain's ability to integrate various data streams allows for a more nuanced understanding of viral behavior.

3. **Real-time Analysis**: The ability to analyze data in real-time can support immediate decision-making. Nextstrain ensures that data is constantly updated and accessible.

By utilizing tools such as Nextstrain, researchers can effectively handle the data deluge and focus on critical aspects of disease control and prevention. The integration of bioinformatics in tracking *SARS-CoV-2* provides invaluable assistance in combating the ongoing health crisis.
