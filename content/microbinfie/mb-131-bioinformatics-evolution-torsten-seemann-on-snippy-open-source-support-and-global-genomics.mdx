In this episode of the Micro Binfie Podcast, host Andrew Page catches
up with Torsten Seemann at the 10th Microbial Bioinformatics Hackathon
in Bethesda, Maryland. They discuss the rapid evolution of
bioinformatics, the challenges faced by labs worldwide, and the
explosion of tools post-COVID. Torsten shares insights into his work
at Melbourne’s Microbiological Diagnostic Unit (MDU), the development
of platforms like OzTracker for bacterial genomics, and how his lab
plays a national and international role in data sharing.  

The conversation dives into the future of the widely-used variant calling
tool Snippy, as Torsten reveals exciting updates funded by the Chan
Zuckerberg Initiative, including nanopore read support and the ability
to process pre-assembled genomes. They also explore the importance of
maintaining open-source bioinformatics tools to prevent them from
becoming obsolete. Tune in for an in-depth discussion on the state of
genomics, software development, and the challenges and rewards of
open-source collaboration.

### Key Points

#### 1. Bioinformatics Landscape
- Significant growth in genomics tools and capabilities post-pandemic
- Challenges faced by international partners in implementing bioinformatics solutions
- Increasing complexity and diversity of available tools

#### 2. OzTracker and National Collaboration
- Development of a surveillance platform for sharing genomic data across Australian state labs
- Expanding national and international data sharing capabilities
- Integration with global platforms like NCBI and WHO

#### 3. Snippy Tool Development
- Secured Chan Zuckerberg Initiative grant for software maintenance
- Planning Snippy Next Generation (Snippy NG) with new features
- Upcoming support for nanopore reads and pre-assembled genomes

### Take-Home Messages
- Maintaining open-source bioinformatics tools is crucial for scientific progress
- Collaborative efforts are key to advancing genomic research globally
- Continuous adaptation and funding are essential for software sustainability
