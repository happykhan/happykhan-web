In this episode of the Micro Binfie Podcast, host Andrew Page catches
up with Torsten Seemann at the 10th Microbial Bioinformatics Hackathon
in Bethesda, Maryland. They discuss the rapid evolution of
bioinformatics, the challenges faced by labs worldwide, and the
explosion of tools post-COVID. Torsten shares insights into his work
at Melbourne’s Microbiological Diagnostic Unit (MDU), the development
of platforms like OzTracker for bacterial genomics, and how his lab
plays a national and international role in data sharing.   The
conversation dives into the future of the widely-used variant calling
tool Snippy, as Torsten reveals exciting updates funded by the Chan
Zuckerberg Initiative, including nanopore read support and the ability
to process pre-assembled genomes. They also explore the importance of
maintaining open-source bioinformatics tools to prevent them from
becoming obsolete. Tune in for an in-depth discussion on the state of
genomics, software development, and the challenges and rewards of
open-source collaboration.
