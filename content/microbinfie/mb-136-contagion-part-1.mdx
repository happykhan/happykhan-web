In a two-part discussion, the hosts analyze the movie Contagion from their expert perspectives, focusing on the film's portrayal of epidemiology and genomics. They note that the movie compresses timelines for dramatic effect, speeding up the virus's spread and the response to it, and that decisions about managing a crisis are based on societal values, not just science.

In part one, the hosts discuss the movie's depiction of the R0 value. They note that while this explanation is useful for the audience, it is unlikely that an epidemiologist would need to explain this concept to other epidemiologists. The group notes that the MEV1 virus is modeled on the real-life Nipah virus and comment on a scene where the genome of the virus is described as being 15 to 19 kilobases in length with 6 to 10 genes. They also discuss the movie's depiction of virus isolation and the unrealistic speed with which the initial assessment of the virus occurs. The podcasters touch upon the BSL4 lab and how the film depicts how the scientists behave. They also discuss the character of Matt Damon, who is exposed to the virus but does not get sick, and is an example of an asymptomatic carrier.

In part two, the bioinformaticians examine the "genome dashboard" scene, noting the software's informative interface, which includes an alignment panel, protein structure, and a recombination map. They also discuss a scene where a phylogenetic tree is used to determine a change in the R0 value. They find this unrealistic because the tree is just a picture that doesn't accurately represent how a virus spreads. The group discusses how the bioinformatician is depicted in the film as moving in and out of the lab, which may have been realistic in 2011 but is less so in the present day. They discuss how the CDC is portrayed in the film, noting scenes that were filmed at the actual CDC, as well as their experiences at the CDC. The podcasters note the movie is very US-centric and that many international partners would be involved in solving a global pandemic.
