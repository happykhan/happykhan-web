# Discussion on SARS-CoV-2 Genomics with Peter van Heusden

We are excited to have Peter van Heusden join us to discuss the latest developments in *SARS-CoV-2* genomics, focusing particularly on the tools and resources available. Additionally, we will delve into the challenges of building and sharing data in large-scale sequencing endeavors.

## Tools and Resources

- **Nextalign**  
  Latest releases can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade/releases).

- **COG Mutation Explorer**  
  Access the mutation explorer [here](http://sars2.cvr.gla.ac.uk/cog-uk/).
