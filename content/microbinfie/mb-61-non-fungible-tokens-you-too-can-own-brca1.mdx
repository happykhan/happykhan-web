In this episode of the microbinfie podcast, the hosts explore the fascinating world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and their potential applications in genomics, blockchain technology, and scientific data management.

In this piece, we delve into the intriguing world of NFTs (*non-fungible tokens*) and blockchain technology, examining in a light-hearted fashion how these could revolutionize the fields of genomics and bioinformatics. We even suggest a radical idea: replacing all central genome databases with our envisioned cryptocurrency, either *BioBucks* or perhaps *GenomeCoin*.

## The Advent of NFTs and Blockchain in Genomics

NFTs have taken the digital world by storm, providing a unique avenue for owning and trading digital assets. The potential application of blockchain and NFTs in genomics could enable secure, verifiable, and decentralized storage and transaction of genomic data. This approach might not only safeguard personal information but also enhance the efficiency of genomic data sharing across the scientific community.

## Legal and Economic Perspectives

For those interested in the intersection of genomics and intellectual property, the Myriad Genetics legal decision provides important context. You can read more about it in the [SCOTUS decision](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-398_1b7d.pdf). Additionally, NPR's [Planet Money episode](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/937167323) explores the complexities of patenting genes, a hot-button issue that could be influenced by the adoption of NFTs in the field.

## The Financial Dimension

The explosive sale of digital artwork by Beeple, which fetched $69 million, illustrates the financial power of NFTs. You can read more about this high-profile sale on [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million). Blockchain technology could similarly transform genomic data transaction, making it as lucrative and revolutionary as digital art.

## Creating and Trading Genomic NFTs

Interested in creating your own NFTs or trading them? Resources like [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/how-to-create-buy-sell-nfts) offer guides on how to create, buy, and sell NFTs. These step-by-step processes could be tailored to genomic data, establishing a new marketplace for bioinformatics research.
