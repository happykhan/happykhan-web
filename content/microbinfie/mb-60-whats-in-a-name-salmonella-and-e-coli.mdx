In this episode of the microbinfie podcast, the hosts dive deep into the complex world of enteric microbes, exploring the nuanced nomenclature and genomic characteristics of *E. coli* and *Salmonella*.

Today, we're diving into the world of some of our favorite enteric microbes: *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*) and *Salmonella*. These bacteria play significant roles in microbiology, and understanding their naming conventions can help in grasping their complexities.

## Why the Names?

### *Escherichia coli*

The name *Escherichia coli* honors Theodor Escherich, the Austrian pediatrician and bacteriologist who discovered it. The abbreviation "*E. coli*" is commonly used in scientific literature and discussions.

### *Salmonella*

*Salmonella* was named after Daniel Elmer Salmon, an American veterinary pathologist. This genus is known for its vast serovar diversity, classified under the Kauffman–White classification scheme.

For more detailed information on *Salmonella* serovars, you can refer to the [Wikipedia page on Kauffman–White classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kauffman%E2%80%93White_classification).

## Primer on ANI (Average Nucleotide Identity)

Understanding the genetic differences and similarities among microbial strains involves metrics like Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI). The concept of ANI is crucial for delineating between different species and strains of bacteria. You can learn more about ANI in this [PNAS publication](https://www.pnas.org/content/102/7/2567.short).

## Nabil's Viral Tweet

For a lighter take and some social media context, check out Nabil's viral tweet about these microbes on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/happy_khan/status/1387804862830809091?s=20).

### Key Points

#### 1. Enteric Microbiology Fundamentals
- Enteric refers to microbes found in the human gut, from mouth to intestines
- Not all microbes in the gut are pathogens; transmission and impact vary
- Different microbes can have complex clinical presentations

#### 2. *E. coli* Genomic Diversity
- Extremely diverse genome with high recombination rates
- Different pathotypes (*EPEC*, *STEC*) defined by specific genomic features
- Commensal strains can serve as genetic reservoirs for potential pathogens

#### 3. Salmonella Characteristics
- Over 2,500 serovars with complex taxonomic relationships
- Some serovars show remarkable genomic stability
- Genetic diversity varies across different environmental contexts

### Take-Home Messages
- Microbial classification is complex and often historically contingent
- Genomic features don't always predict clinical outcomes
- Bacterial evolution involves constant genetic remix and adaptation
