In this episode of the microbinfie podcast, Associate Professor Torsten Seemann shares insights into developing effective bioinformatics software, drawing from his extensive experience creating widely-used tools like Prokka, Snippy, and Barrnap.

Join us for an insightful discussion with Torsten Seemann, a renowned bioinformatician and software developer. Torsten is the author of several widely-used bioinformatics tools that have contributed significantly to the field. His notable tools include:

- **Prokka**: Rapid prokaryotic genome annotation.
- **Snippy**: Efficient variant calling and core genome alignment.
- **Barrnap**: Fast ribosomal RNA prediction.
- **Abricate**: Mass screening of contigs for antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes using BLAST.
- **Shovill**: Assembler and pipeline for assembling bacterial isolate Illumina reads.
- **Nullarbor**: A pipeline for bacterial genome assembly, annotation, and reporting.
