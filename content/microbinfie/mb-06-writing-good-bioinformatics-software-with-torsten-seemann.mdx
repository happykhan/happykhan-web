# Torsten Seemann on Writing Good Bioinformatics Software

We are excited to have Torsten Seemann join us to discuss best practices in writing bioinformatics software. Torsten is a renowned author of numerous widely-used bioinformatics tools, including:

- **Prokka**: Rapid bacterial genome annotation.
- **Snippy**: A tool for rapid variant calling and core genome alignment.
- **Barrnap**: A tool for predicting ribosomal RNA genes.
- **Abricate**: A tool for the mass screening of contigs for antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes.
- **Shovill**: For assembling bacterial isolate genomes from Illumina paired-end reads.
- **Nullarbor**: Pipeline for bacterial genome sequencing QC and genome sequence analysis.

For more information about Torsten's tools and contributions, visit his [GitHub page](https://github.com/tseemann).

Join us as Torsten shares his insights on developing effective and sustainable bioinformatics software.
