We recently had the opportunity to chat with Phil Ashton about his fascinating career transition from the wet lab to the dry lab, taking on the role of a bioinformatician. Below, Phil shares his experiences working in public health and in low and middle-income countries.

### Guests
* **Phil Ashton**, a bioinformatician at the Malawi Liverpool Welcome Unit, shares his transition from a wet lab to bioinformatics.

#### Phil's Career Journey
- **Move to Vietnam**: 
  - Phil and his wife relocated shortly after their wedding in September 2016.
  - The decision was somewhat spontaneous, motivated by a job offer found on Twitter regarding fungal genomes.
  - Worked on **Cryptococcus meningitis**, affecting individuals with HIV.

- **Family Life in Vietnam**: 
  - Their son, Joshua, was born in Vietnam.
  - Vietnamese culture is very child-friendly; locals are welcoming towards children.

- **Transition to Malawi**: 
  - Moved to Malawi for his wife's job as a lead molecular biologist.
  - Phil joined just before the pandemic-induced flight cancellations.

#### Working Conditions in Malawi
- **Infrastructure**: 
  - The Malawi Liverpool Welcome Unit is well-resourced but faces challenges like power cuts due to insufficient electricity production, especially in dry seasons.
  - Internet access is primarily 4G, with concerns about data costs and usage. 

- **Living Arrangements**: 
  - The couple lives in a community rather than a compound, making it easier to integrate with locals.
  - They have an inverter to manage power outages, allowing for basic home functions.

#### Bioinformatics and Research
- **Computational Work**: 
  - Relies on the MRC Climb big data resource for data analysis.
  - Emphasizes the importance of remote access due to the challenges in downloading large datasets.

- **Current Research Focus**: 
  - Primarily works on **Salmonella typhi** and **non-typhoidal Salmonella**.
  - Collaborating with Professor Melita Gordon on a large vaccine study involving Salmonella typhi, focusing on sequencing and drug resistance issues.

- **Challenges in Drug Resistance**: 
  - Discusses differences in drug resistance patterns between regions, particularly comparing African and South Asian contexts regarding Salmonella.

These points summarize Phil Ashton's journey, experiences in Vietnam and Malawi, and his current research efforts in microbial bioinformatics.
