### Extra notes

- **Microbial Bioinformatics Insights**:
  - Expansion from bacterial to fungal genomics: Phil transitioned from bacterial to fungal bioinformatics, specifically Cryptococcus meningitis, noticing that fungal bioinformatics was underdeveloped compared to bacterial.
  - Data infrastructure challenges: In Malawi, limitations include reliance on 4G Wi-Fi and high data costs, impacting the ability to download large datasets like BAM files. Regular power cuts necessitate alternative power solutions such as inverters.

- **Technical Tools and Methodologies**:
  - Use of MRC CLIMB: Phil uses the MRC CLIMB infrastructure for data processing, which he describes as invaluable.
  - Bioinformatics pipelines: Utilizes Phoenix for Salmonella typing, leveraging PHE pipeline for processing reads to SNPs, with a focus on phylogenetics.
  - Genotyphi tool: Collaborates with Cat Holt's lab using genotyphi for typhoid analysis, aiding in the categorization and analysis of typhoid strains.

- **Ongoing Research and Challenges**:
  - Focus on Salmonella: Research on Salmonella typhi and non-typhoidal Salmonella, including a study on typhoid vaccine efficacy and antibiotic resistance issues.
  - Future research interests: Exploring E. coli and diarrheal pathogens, with a potential focus on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify virulence factors.

- **Collaborative and Ethical Considerations**:
  - Seeking collaborators: Phil is interested in collaborating on E. coli projects, particularly in immunology, reflecting a proactive approach to research collaboration.
  - Ethical framework for studies: Emphasizes ethical conduct in prospective studies involving human samples, such as those from healthy and sick children.

- **Career Development and Community Engagement**:
  - Career transition and independence: Focus on achieving independence through fellowships, highlighting the importance of career development in academia.
  - Community-based living: Living and integrating within the local community in Malawi, rather than in isolated compounds.

- **General Insights**:
  - Adaptability to resource constraints: The experience of working in resource-limited settings underscores adaptability, patience, and innovative problem-solving in microbial bioinformatics.
  - Contribution to global health: The work in high-burden countries like Malawi reflects the intersection of bioinformatics, public health, and epidemiology in addressing global infectious disease challenges.
