What are the major challenges for getting AMR genomics into the
clinic?  This was the question poised to a panel of experts at the 7th
Microbial Bioinformatics hackathon run in conjunction with JPIAMR,
PHA4GE and CLIMB.  The panel were: Mark Pallen from the Quadram
Institute Bioscience, UK, Finlay Maguire from Dalhousie University,
Canada, Anthony Underwood from the Centre for genomic pathogen
surveillance, UK and Clement Tsui from the Weill Cornell Medicine,
Qatar. Andrew Page was the Chair, supported by Lee Katz.
