In this episode, we delve into the widely used **Sequence Alignment Map** (SAM) format. This format is essential for storing biological sequence alignment data.

The episode focuses on the SAM format, a standard file format used in bioinformatics for storing alignment information between sequencing reads and reference genomes.
SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) was created by Heng Li at the Sanger Institute in 2009, and is widely used in combination with tools like BWA for aligning short reads.

* SAM is a plain-text format for human readability.
* BAM is the binary version of SAM, designed for faster processing.
* CRAM is a compressed format, allowing for lossy or lossless data storage.

These formats help manage the increasing data generated from modern sequencing technologies, especially short-read sequencing.

Before the development of SAM, older alignment formats and tools like Fred, Frapp, and CONSED were used. These formats were clunky, non-parsable, and difficult to work with.
The rise of Illumina sequencing and its vast data output (starting with 37 base reads) pushed the need for a more efficient and scalable alignment format, leading to the creation of SAM.
