# Podcast Review: The Role of GPT-4 in Academic Publishing

The podcast features a discussion on an article co-authored by Andrew Page, examining the role of GPT-4 in research publication. The conversation focuses mainly on the authorship of articles generated with the help of GPT-4 and the implications for academic publishing.

## Authorship and Ethics

Andrew raises the question of authorship with AI-generated content in research articles. He explores the ethical implications and potential biases that come with AI-assisted writing, such as the risk of omitting minority figures and novel discoveries. Emphasizing the importance of transparency, Andrew suggests that while AI has the potential to democratize research, it is imperative to adhere to ethical guidelines.

## AI & Scientific Journals

The podcast takes a deeper look into the current landscape of AI in academic publishing. It addresses the commercial use of AI in crafting manuscripts and the necessity to distinguish between manual and AI-generated contributions. The conversation highlights the potential misalignment of GPT-4's commercial objectives with academic goals.

## Risks and Benefits

Andrew outlines the risks associated with using AI in publishing, which include the threat of unintentional plagiarism, biases, and reliance on outdated methods. He cites an example involving bioinformatics software recommending deprecated methods, illustrating the need for caution. Furthermore, the discussion touches upon AI's potential to introduce bias inadvertently, referencing past incidents where AI models adopted extremist views quickly.

## Perspectives from Co-authors

Andrew's co-authors, Niamh Tumelty and Sam Sheppard, offer varied perspectives on ethics and the impact of AI on publishing. Niamh, from the London School of Economics, emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations. Meanwhile, Sam, the editor-in-chief of *Microbial Genomics*, stresses the necessity to adapt to the reality of AI contributions in journal submissions.

## Conclusion

The podcast underscores the importance of navigating the ethical challenges posed by AI in academic publishing. It highlights the rapid pace at which technology like AI may evolve, outstripping the speed at which policies can adapt. This underscores the need for an ongoing dialogue among researchers, publishers, and AI developers.
