We recently had a conversation with the author of *SNP-sites*, (it's Andrew!) a bioinformatics software designed for extracting Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from a multi-FASTA alignment. While the software may seem straightforward, it involves intricate details that are often absent from the final published work.

**Software Repository:**  
[SNP-sites on GitHub](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/snp-sites)

**Research Paper:**  
"[SNP-sites: rapid efficient extraction of SNPs from multi-FASTA alignments](https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/mgen/10.1099/mgen.0.000056)"  
*Authors: Andrew J. Page, Ben Taylor, Aidan J. Delaney, Jorge Soares, Torsten Seemann, Jacqueline A. Keane, Simon R. Harris*
