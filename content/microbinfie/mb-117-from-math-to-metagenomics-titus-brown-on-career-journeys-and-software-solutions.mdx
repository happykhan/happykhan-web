This episode offers valuable insights into the world of bioinformatics and the innovative approaches being taken to address challenges in genomic data analysis.

### Extra notes

- The podcast discusses the evolution and application of *k-mer* analysis in bioinformatics, particularly for handling large-scale genomic data.
- *Digital normalization* is highlighted as a technique for managing data from deeply sequenced genomic datasets, which helps prevent computational workload overload by estimating coverage and discarding redundant reads.
- *SourMash* is a tool developed for *MinHash*-based analysis of *k-mers*, allowing efficient storage and comparison of genomic data by discarding 99.9% of *k-mers*, reducing memory and disk space requirements.
- The challenges of data reuse, interoperability, and socio-technical solutions in the context of *FAIR* (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) principles in bioinformatics are discussed.
- Collaboration and mentorship through open source platforms and tutorials play a crucial role in advancing the field, as evidenced by the uptake of developed tools without direct researcher involvement.
- The discussion briefly touches on a new method called *Gambit* from *David Hess's* lab, which focuses on targeted *k-mer* analysis, using specific prefixes to facilitate more accurate bacterial typing.
- The speaker mentions their involvement in large NIH consortia, emphasizing practical infrastructure implementation for large-scale data reuse, which underlines the complexity of global data sharing initiatives.
- The podcaster shares personal reflections on creativity and career evolution, acknowledging that career progression is often non-linear, driven by curiosity and adaptability rather than formal training alone.
