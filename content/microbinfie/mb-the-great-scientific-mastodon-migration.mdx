Over the past few weeks scientists have been swapping Twitter for
Mastodon. Our very own Nabil-Fareed Alikhan talks about his experience
with setting up and running a Mastodon server called
https://mstdn.science which is one of the places where scientists have
moved over to.  We are joined by Emma Hodcroft to get an independent
scientists view on the whole thing.
