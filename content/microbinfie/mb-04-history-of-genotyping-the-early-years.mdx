Genotyping forms the foundation of modern microbiology, providing insights into the genetic composition of organisms. Before the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), several techniques were employed to analyze genetic material. This guide explores the primary methods used in the pre-NGS era.

## Key Techniques in Pre-NGS Genotyping

1. **Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP)**
   - RFLP analyzes variations in DNA sequences by digesting DNA with specific restriction enzymes, resulting in fragments of varying lengths.
   - These fragment patterns can be visualized by gel electrophoresis, providing a "genetic fingerprint."

2. **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)**
   - PCR is a technique used to amplify specific DNA sequences exponentially, enabling detailed study even from small DNA samples.
   - It is a cornerstone technique still widely used for many applications.

3. **Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)**
   - RAPD utilizes short, random primers to amplify DNA segments, revealing polymorphic patterns.
   - This method is relatively quick and cost-effective but can be less reproducible than other techniques.

4. **Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP)**
   - AFLP combines the principles of RFLP and PCR, giving high-resolution profiles of DNA polymorphisms.
   - It involves cutting DNA with restriction enzymes, ligating specific adaptors, and selective amplification.

5. **Microsatellite Analysis (SSR)**
   - Microsatellites, or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), are short, tandemly repeated DNA sequences.
   - Variations in the number of repeated sequences can be analyzed to differentiate between genotypes.

6. **Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Analysis**
   - SNPs are single base-pair variations in the genome.
   - Techniques like SNP microarrays were developed to study these variations across genomes systematically.

7. **Whole Genome Sequencing (Sanger Sequencing)**
   - Though limited by length and speed compared to NGS, Sanger sequencing allows detailed examination of specific regions or whole genomes.
   - It was one of the first methods to provide complete sequence data and remains a gold standard for many applications.

While the advent of NGS has transformed the field of genomics, these foundational techniques of the pre-NGS era played a crucial role in advancing our understanding of microbial genetics. Each method offers unique insights and applications suited to various research needs in microbiology.

### Extra notes

- **Traditional Microbial Typing Methods**:
  - Techniques such as *plasma typing*, *phage typing*, and *serotyping* have been historically used to define microbes based on susceptibility or morphological characteristics.
  - Other methods include genotyping approaches like *pulsed-field gel electrophoresis* (PFGE), *MILVA* (microsatellite analysis), and *MLST* (Multi-Locus Sequence Typing), which look at household genes across the genome.

- **Transition to Modern Genomics**:
  - The shift from traditional methods to modern genomics involves integration with *whole genome sequencing* (WGS), which provides better resolution for strain analysis and understanding phylogeny.
  - PFGE has been difficult to directly correlate with WGS due to differing genetic markers and susceptibility to factors like methylation blocking restriction enzymes.
  
- **Current Use of Classic Techniques**:
  - Classic typing methods such as *serotyping* for *Salmonella* remain gold standards in some contexts despite the move towards WGS.
  - Rapid methods like PFGE and MILVA are still used for quick and reliable classification, although they don't fully represent a genome's phylogeny.

- **Data Coordination and Sharing Platforms**:
  - *PulseNet* is a significant platform for coordinating microbial surveillance and outbreak response using methods like PFGE and now integrating WGS.
  - *GenomeTracker*, an FDA initiative, uses NCBI for centralized genome analysis and data sharing, expanding to platforms like *Galaxy* Tracker.

- **Bioinformatics Tool Utilization**:
  - *Galaxy* and *IRIDA* are emphasized as platforms for developing scalable bioinformatics workflows, enabling cloud and local HPC solutions.
  - These tools democratize bioinformatics by allowing users to build and share customized workflows globally, fostering collaboration.

- **Surveillance and Profiling Techniques**:
  - Genomic and phenotypic profiling, such as analyzing virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes, aid in characterizing pathogen diversity and linking outbreaks.
  - Historical techniques still play a role in niche identification and epidemiological studies alongside newer genomic approaches.

- **Challenges and Evolution**:
  - There is an ongoing transition from serotyping and PFGE to WGS for comprehensive microbial surveillance, with challenges including resource allocations and legacy method dependencies.
  - Efforts are being made to synchronize global data sharing through initiatives like NCBI and ENA collaborations.

Overall, the field of microbial bioinformatics stands at the intersection of traditional methodologies and modern genomic advancements, focusing on increasing data accuracy, sharing, and practical applications in public health.
