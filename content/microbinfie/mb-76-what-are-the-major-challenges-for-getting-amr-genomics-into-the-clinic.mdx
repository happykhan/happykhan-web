## Major Challenges for Getting AMR Genomics into the Clinic

At the 7th Microbial Bioinformatics Hackathon, which was held in conjunction with JPIAMR, PHA4GE, and CLIMB, a panel of experts discussed the major challenges of integrating antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genomics into clinical settings. The panel was composed of esteemed professionals in the field:

- **Mark Pallen** from the Quadram Institute Bioscience, UK
- **Finlay Maguire** from Dalhousie University, Canada
- **Anthony Underwood** from the Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance, UK
- **Clement Tsui** from Weill Cornell Medicine, Qatar

The session was chaired by Andrew Page, with support from Lee Katz.

### Key Challenges Identified:

1. **Data Interpretation and Standardization**
    - The complexity of interpreting genomic data and the need for standardized practices across different laboratories and institutions.

2. **Integration with Clinical Workflows**
    - Challenges in incorporating genomic insights seamlessly into existing clinical processes and decision-making.

3. **Cost and Accessibility**
    - High costs associated with genomic testing and analysis, alongside ensuring widespread accessibility in diverse healthcare settings.

4. **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations**
    - Navigating the regulatory frameworks and ethical considerations that accompany the use of genomic information in clinical care.

5. **Education and Training**
    - The necessity for comprehensive education and training for healthcare professionals to effectively utilize genomic data.

By addressing these challenges, the integration of AMR genomics into clinical practice could significantly enhance the understanding and management of antimicrobial resistance.

The speakers on the MicroBinFeed podcast include Dr. Lee Katz, Dr. Nabil Ali Khan, Dr. Andrew Page, Mark Pallon, Phil McGuire, Anthony Underwood, and Clement.
