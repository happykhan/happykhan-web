The integration of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genomics into clinical settings presents several significant challenges. These were the focus of a panel discussion during the 7th Microbial Bioinformatics Hackathon, organized in association with JPIAMR, PHA4GE, and CLIMB. The panel comprised experts from various institutions:

- **Mark Pallen** from the Quadram Institute Bioscience, UK
- **Finlay Maguire** from Dalhousie University, Canada
- **Anthony Underwood** from the Centre for Genomic Pathogen Surveillance, UK
- **Clement Tsui** from Weill Cornell Medicine, Qatar

The session was chaired by **Andrew Page**, with support from **Lee Katz**.

### Key Challenges Discussed:

1. **Data Interpretation and Standardization**: 
   - Harmonizing diverse data types for consistent interpretation across different genomic platforms.
   - Developing standardized guidelines for interpreting genomic data in the clinical context.

2. **Infrastructure and Resources**:
   - The need for robust computational infrastructure to handle large-scale genomic data.
   - Ensuring access to necessary resources and funding for ongoing genomic initiatives.

3. **Clinical Utility and Integration**:
   - Demonstrating the direct clinical value and actionable nature of genomic data to healthcare providers.
   - Integrating genomic findings into existing clinical workflows and electronic health records.

4. **Regulatory and Ethical Concerns**:
   - Addressing ethical issues related to patient data privacy and consent.
   - Navigating complex regulatory landscapes to ensure compliance and patient safety.

5. **Education and Training**:
   - Providing sufficient training for healthcare professionals to interpret and utilize genomic data effectively.
   - Raising awareness and understanding of genomic technologies within the medical community.

6. **Collaborative Efforts**:
   - Fostering international collaboration to share data, resources, and knowledge.
   - Encouraging partnerships between academic, governmental, and private sectors to advance genomic applications.

Addressing these challenges requires a concerted effort from the scientific community, healthcare providers, policy-makers, and other stakeholders to realize the full potential of AMR genomics in clinical practice.
