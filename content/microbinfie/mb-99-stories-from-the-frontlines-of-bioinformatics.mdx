At the 8th Microbial Bioinformatics Hackathon in Bath we talked to a
live panel with Kristy Horan, Torsten Seemann, Finlay Maguire and
Andrew Page about bioinformatics from the frontlines.    We apologise
for the poor audio quality, it was recorded in a room with 20 people
in the background so at points it got a bit loud, however we felt you
might enjoy the discussion regardless.
