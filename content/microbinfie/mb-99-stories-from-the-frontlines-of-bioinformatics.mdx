# 8th Microbial Bioinformatics Hackathon

At the 8th Microbial Bioinformatics Hackathon in Bath, we had the opportunity to engage with a live panel featuring Kristy Horan, Torsten Seemann, Finlay Maguire, and Andrew Page. The discussion focused on bioinformatics from the frontlines.

> _Note: We apologize for the poor audio quality. The recording took place in a room with approximately 20 people in the background, which occasionally made the audio slightly loud. However, we hope you still enjoy the insightful discussion._
