# 8th Microbial Bioinformatics Hackathon Recap

During the 8th Microbial Bioinformatics Hackathon in Bath, we hosted a live panel discussion featuring:

- **Kristy Horan**
- **Torsten Seemann**
- **Finlay Maguire**
- **Andrew Page**

The panel discussed various aspects of bioinformatics from the frontlines.

## Panel Highlights

Despite some audio challenges—due to the recording being done in a room with 20 participants—we believe the content of the discussion offers valuable insights into the field of microbial bioinformatics.

We apologize for the moments when the audio quality might make it difficult to hear, as background noise occasionally became intrusive. Nonetheless, we hope you enjoy and benefit from this engaging conversation. 

Stay tuned for more updates and discussions from the world of microbial bioinformatics!

The guest speakers on the Microbial Bioinformatics podcast are Torsten Seemann from the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia; Finlay McGuire from Dalhousie University in Canada and the Shared Hospital Lab in Toronto; and Christy Horan from the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit (MDU) in Victoria, Australia.
