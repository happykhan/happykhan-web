# Bacterial Taxonomy and Genomics

In this discussion, we explore how genomics has transformed bacterial taxonomy with insights from:

- **Professor Phil Hugenholtz**
- **Professor Iain Sutcliffe**
- **Professor Mark Pallen**

## Selective Bibliography

For further reading, a selective bibliography is available. You can access it [here](https://github.com/MicroBinfie/MicroBinfie.github.io/blob/45db8eb57d732176449073065dbdacc88a288fe9/assets/Taxonomy_Selective_bibliography.pdf). 

This bibliography provides key resources and literature that discuss the impact of genomics on bacterial taxonomy.

The speakers on the MicroBinfeed podcast's holiday special on bacterial taxonomy included Ian Sutcliffe, Professor Phil Hugenholtz, and Professor Mark Palin, alongside the hosts Dr. Nabil Ali Khan and Dr. Andrew Page, with a mention of Dr. Lee Katz from the CDC.
