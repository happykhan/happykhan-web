## Bacterial Taxonomy and the Impact of Genomics

In our ongoing series on bacterial taxonomy, we explore how genomics has revolutionized this field. Joining us for this discussion are:

- **Professor Phil Hugenholtz**
- **Professor Iain Sutcliffe**
- **Professor Mark Pallen**

## Discussion Highlights

Genomics has significantly altered the framework of bacterial taxonomy by:

1. **Refining Phylogenetic Relationships**: Genomics allows for more precise phylogenetic trees based on DNA sequences rather than solely on phenotypic characteristics.

2. **Discovering New Lineages**: The ability to sequence genomes quickly and affordably has led to the discovery of previously unknown bacterial lineages.

3. **Clarifying Species Concepts**: Genomic data has helped clarify what constitutes a bacterial species, challenging many traditional concepts.

## Learning More

For a deeper dive into the impact of genomics on bacterial taxonomy, you can refer to our [selective bibliography](https://github.com/MicroBinfie/MicroBinfie.github.io/blob/45db8eb57d732176449073065dbdacc88a288fe9/assets/Taxonomy_Selective_bibliography.pdf) compiled by the experts in this discussion.

This bibliography provides a curated list of seminal papers and resources that explore the intersection of genomics and bacterial taxonomy.
