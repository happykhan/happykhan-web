In this episode of the Micro Binfie Podcast, host Andrew Page takes listeners to the heart of the microbial genomics hackathon in Bethesda, Maryland, for an engaging conversation with special guest Megan Phillips, a PhD student from Emory University. Megan delves into her research on Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), highlighting its fascinating dual nature as both a harmless and potentially serious pathogen.

Megan discusses the complexities of tetracycline resistance, particularly focusing on plasmid-mediated mechanisms involving the pt181 plasmid. She explains how this plasmid’s efflux pump, encoded by the gene tetK, contributes to variable resistance levels and the factors influencing MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) variability. Listeners will learn about the intricacies of plasmid copy numbers, their global spread across clonal complexes, and the occurrence of horizontal and vertical gene transfer.

Throughout the episode, Megan shares insights on working with short-read sequencing data and the strategies she employs to detect plasmid presence using tools like BLAST. She also touches on the challenges and fascinating discoveries of tracking historical sample data and integrating findings from older research papers, showcasing her appreciation for the poetic style of scientific writing from the 1940s.

For those interested in antimicrobial resistance, evolutionary microbiology, and the subtleties of bacterial genome analysis, this episode offers a compelling blend of technical details and engaging storytelling. Tune in to hear more about Megan’s upcoming publications, her experiences navigating complex genomic data, and her thoughts on antimicrobial stewardship and historical perspectives on drug resistance.
