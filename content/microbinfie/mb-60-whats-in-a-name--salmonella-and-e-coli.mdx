# Understanding Enteric Microbes: *E. coli* and *Salmonella*

Today, we're diving into the world of some of our favorite enteric microbes: *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*) and *Salmonella*. These bacteria play significant roles in microbiology, and understanding their naming conventions can help in grasping their complexities.

## Why the Names?

### *Escherichia coli*

The name *Escherichia coli* honors Theodor Escherich, the Austrian pediatrician and bacteriologist who discovered it. The abbreviation "*E. coli*" is commonly used in scientific literature and discussions.

### *Salmonella*

*Salmonella* was named after Daniel Elmer Salmon, an American veterinary pathologist. This genus is known for its vast serovar diversity, classified under the Kauffman–White classification scheme.

For more detailed information on *Salmonella* serovars, you can refer to the [Wikipedia page on Kauffman–White classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kauffman%E2%80%93White_classification).

## Primer on ANI (Average Nucleotide Identity)

Understanding the genetic differences and similarities among microbial strains involves metrics like Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI). The concept of ANI is crucial for delineating between different species and strains of bacteria. You can learn more about ANI in this [PNAS publication](https://www.pnas.org/content/102/7/2567.short).

## Nabil's Viral Tweet

For a lighter take and some social media context, check out Nabil's viral tweet about these microbes on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/happy_khan/status/1387804862830809091?s=20).

Understanding the scientific naming conventions and classifications of these microbes helps in appreciating their roles in health and disease. Whether you're a microbiologist or a curious learner, diving into the world of *E. coli* and *Salmonella* can be both informative and fascinating.
