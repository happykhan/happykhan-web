# Getting to Know Enteric Microbes: E. coli and Salmonella

Today, we're diving into some of our favorite enteric microbes: **E. coli** and **Salmonella**. These microorganisms are fascinating subjects in microbiology and are notable for their roles in both health and disease.

## Why Their Names?

Understanding the naming of these microbes involves some scientific background:

- **E. coli**: Short for *Escherichia coli*, this bacterium is named after Theodor Escherich, the German-Austrian pediatrician who discovered it. It's commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms and is usually harmless, though certain strains can cause severe food poisoning.

- **Salmonella**: Named after Daniel Elmer Salmon, an American veterinary pathologist. It's notorious for causing salmonellosis. The classification of Salmonella into different serovars follows the Kauffman–White classification.

## Additional Reading

- **Primer on ANI (Average Nucleotide Identity)**: This approach helps understand the genetic relationships between microbial species. More details can be found in the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences article](https://www.pnas.org/content/102/7/2567.short).

- **Wikipedia on Salmonella serovars**: The Kauffman–White classification aids in identifying different serotypes of Salmonella, essential for diagnosis and treatment. You can learn more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kauffman%E2%80%93White_classification).

## Interesting Take

- **Nabil’s Viral Tweet**: Nabil's humorous and insightful take on these microbes went viral on Twitter. Check it out [here](https://twitter.com/happy_khan/status/1387804862830809091?s=20).

Understanding these microorganisms helps in the fields of microbiology, epidemiology, and public health, providing insights into preventing and controlling diseases caused by them.
