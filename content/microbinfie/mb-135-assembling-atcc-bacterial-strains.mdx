In this episode of the Micro Binfie podcast, host Andrew Page is joined by Nikhita Puthuveetil, Senior Bioinformatician at the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). They delve into ATCC's ambitious project of sequencing a vast array of organisms from their renowned collection, tackling the challenges of assembling complex genomes from bacteria, viruses, fungi, and more. Discover how Nikhita and her team navigate through genomic roadblocks, leverage cutting-edge sequencing technologies, and work to ensure accurate data provenance. Whether it's large viral genomes or evolving taxonomy, this episode offers a deep dive into the fascinating world of microbial bioinformatics and genomic curation.
