# The Ups and Downs of Doing a Postdoc

## Introduction

The discussion, featuring Dr. Emma Waters, Dr. Heather Felgate, Dr. Muhammad Yasir, and Dr. Andrew Page, focuses on the positives and negatives of pursuing a postdoctoral position. It was recorded live at the Microbes, Microbiomes, and Bioinformatics doctoral training program in the Quadram Institute, Norwich, UK, in front of an audience of first-year PhD students.

## Highlights from the Panel

### Dr. Emma Waters

Emma begins the session by expressing her passion for research and problem-solving. She highlights the thrill of discovery and exploration as key attractions of a postdoc role.

### Dr. Heather Felgate

Heather echoes Emma's sentiments and adds that she enjoys where she is currently, appreciating the flexibility of academia. This flexibility has enabled her to maintain a balance between her professional and personal life, rather than chasing after higher-paying jobs in the industry.

### Main Concerns

A significant concern raised by PhD students is whether the postdocs regret choosing academia given the pay differences compared to industry roles. In response:

- **Emma Points Out:** Despite potentially earning more in the industry, she finds satisfaction in her work in academia, particularly in assisting people. She doesn’t feel the need to chase profits in industry if it lacks personal gratification.

- **Dr. Muhammad Yasir:** Yasir shares his experience of sequencing 600 SARS-CoV-2 samples in Pakistan, contributing to global pandemic efforts. He acknowledges that the freedom and collaboration opportunities in academia were crucial to his success.

## Final Thoughts

### Dr. Andrew Page

- **Advice for Students:** Andrew encourages the students to explore their options and keep their careers open-ended. For those seeking higher salaries, he suggests considering the bioinformatics data science path, which offers potential for higher earnings in the industry.

### Unified Closing Message

The postdocs collectively stress the importance of pursuing happiness and personal fulfillment over merely chasing higher salaries. They encourage students to find an area that brings joy and satisfaction in their careers.

This discussion serves as an insightful overview for first-year PhD students weighing the pros and cons of pursuing a postdoc versus industry roles.

### Extra notes

- The podcast features discussions on **microbial bioinformatics** within academic and postdoctoral research contexts.

- **SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing** project:
  - Collaboration with Pakistan for sequencing about 600 samples.
  - Significant contribution to public health policies by providing evidence on variants, impacting international travel policies.
  - Highlighted the advantage of the academic setup in facilitating such collaborations.

- **Academic vs. industry environments**:
  - Academia offers freedom to pursue independent research and partnerships without being restricted by industrial interests or intellectual property constraints.
  - Examples include flexibility in starting new research projects (e.g., tracking Haemolyticus) and engaging in international collaborations.

- **Tools and methodologies**:
  - Discussion of the various tools available in microbial bioinformatics for tackling complex problems and the joy derived from solving unsolved issues.

- **Challenges in academia** include:
  - The struggle with temporary contracts and reliance on grant funding.
  - Emotional and mental challenges associated with the research process, especially during periods when methodologies aren't working as expected.
  - The balance between passion for research and financial rewards, with a suggestion that bioinformatics and data science might offer better financial prospects compared to wet lab roles.

- **Career advice**: 
  - Exploration of life outside academia can provide valuable experiences.
  - Flexibility in research allows scientists to pursue passions and build diverse skill sets.
  
- The panel emphasizes the importance of happiness and fulfillment in choosing career paths, suggesting bioinformatics as a potentially lucrative field within the scientific research community.

The guest speakers on the MicroBinFeed podcast are postdoctoral researchers Heather Felgate, Dr. Yasir, and Emma Waters.
