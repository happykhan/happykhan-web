# An Honest Discussion on the Pros and Cons of Doing a Postdoc

**Panelists:** Dr. Emma Waters, Dr. Heather Felgate, Dr. Muhammad Yasir, Dr. Andrew Page

**Event:** Microbes, Microbiomes and Bioinformatics Doctoral Training Program  
**Location:** Quadram Institute, Norwich, UK

The discussion started with Dr. Emma Waters expressing her enthusiasm for research, highlighting the joy she finds in problem-solving and utilizing various tools. She emphasized her love for the *thrill of discovery and exploration* that a postdoc position offers.

Dr. Heather Felgate shared similar sentiments, stating that she is content with her current position rather than pursuing higher-paying industry jobs. She values the flexibility that academia provides, allowing her to effectively balance her professional and personal life.

As the conversation progressed, the PhD students posed questions regarding whether the postdocs ever regretted choosing academia, especially given the noticeable pay gap between academia and industry. Dr. Emma Waters acknowledged that while she might have earned more in the industry, she finds fulfillment in the academic realm, particularly in helping others through her work. She noted that chasing profits in the industry would not provide the same level of gratification.

Dr. Muhammad Yasir shared his impactful experience of sequencing 600 samples of the *SARS-CoV-2* virus in Pakistan, a significant contribution to the pandemic response. He attributed his success to the freedom and flexibility of academia, which enables worldwide collaborations.

In conclusion, Dr. Andrew Page advised the students to keep their career options open and to explore different paths. He mentioned the bioinformatics data science field as a potential avenue for those seeking higher salaries in the industry. The consensus among the postdocs was to prioritize personal happiness over financial gain in career choices.

### Extra notes

### Microbial Bioinformatics Insights

- _**Personal Journeys:**_ The podcast discussed the personal journeys of postdoctoral scientists and how their motivations and experiences have influenced their careers in science. Despite the challenges of being in academia, such as low pay and temporary contracts, the pursuit of knowledge and the ability to solve unique problems were key motivators.

- _**SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing Collaboration:**_ A significant project highlighted was the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing in Pakistan, where approximately 600 samples were sequenced. This work contributed significantly to the data pool and influenced travel policies, emphasizing the international impact of microbial bioinformatics research.

- _**Academic vs. Industry Setups:**_ Academic settings were portrayed as more open to collaborations and independent projects compared to industrial environments, which tend to be more profit-driven and IP-conscious. This flexibility allowed for contributions to public health, such as the SARS-CoV-2 sequencing project.

- _**Bioinformatics Tools and Methologies**_ There was a call to explore pathways like bioinformatics and data science instead of traditional lab work due to broader opportunities and earning potential. This reflects a preference for skill sets related to computational biology over bench science.

- _**Flexibility and Freedom in Academia:**_ Academic positions offer more freedom to explore, innovate, and collaborate globally without the constraints of industrial obligations, which can translate into meaningful scientific contributions and personal satisfaction.

The discussion emphasized the diverse opportunities and collaborations possible in microbial bioinformatics and the impact these have, both locally and internationally. These insights highlight the core theme of balancing personal satisfaction and societal contribution in scientific research.
