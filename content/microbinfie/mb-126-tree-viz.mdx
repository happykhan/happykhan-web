# Tree Visualizations Overview

Tree visualizations are an essential tool in many scientific fields, including biology and computer science. They help in representing hierarchical data, phylogenetic trees, evolutionary relationships, and more. Below is a list of prominent tools and platforms that offer tree visualization capabilities:

## Platforms and Tools

### 1. Microreact
- **Website:** [https://microreact.org/](https://microreact.org/)

### 2. Phylocanvas
- **Website:** [https://www.phylocanvas.gl/](https://www.phylocanvas.gl/)

### 3. GrapeTree
- Developed by Achtman Lab
- **Repository:** [https://github.com/achtman-lab/GrapeTree](https://github.com/achtman-lab/GrapeTree)

### 4. Auspice / NextStrain
- **Website:** [https://nextstrain.org/](https://nextstrain.org/)

### 5. Taxonium
- **Website:** [https://taxonium.org/](https://taxonium.org/)

### 6. iTOL (Interactive Tree of Life)
- **Website:** [https://itol.embl.de/](https://itol.embl.de/)

### 7. PhyloViz
- **Website:** [https://online.phyloviz.net/index](https://online.phyloviz.net/index)

### 8. Phandango

These platforms provide various functionalities for visualizing, analyzing, and sharing tree data, making them valuable resources for researchers and scientists working with complex hierarchical or phylogenetic data.

## Additional summary:

- **Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs):** Discussion on the use of MSTs in microbial bioinformatics, specifically through tools like GrapeTree, which can visualize both MSTs and regular phylogenetic trees.

- **Tree Visualization Tools:**
  - **MASHtree** generates trees, often not phylogenetic, with command-line ASCII outputs.
  - **ictree.org** is a web-based tool for visualizing trees, offering features like search, tree annotation via Nexus, skyline plots, and visualizations of tips.
  - **Nextstrain and Auspice:** Nextstrain is known for its time phylogenies, especially used during COVID-19 for viral evolution, with Auspice allowing for personal data integration and visualization.
  - **MicroReact:** Allows users to upload a tree with metadata, sharing links for dynamic visualization. Utilizes Phylocanvas for its tree viewer capabilities.
  - **Fandango:** Integrates with Phylocanvas for visualizing trees alongside metadata, including gene presence and recombinant sites.
  - **ITOL (Interactive Tree Of Life):** Offers comprehensive tree visualization features with some requiring a subscription for full functionality.

- **Advanced Visualization Techniques:**
  - **Tanglograms:** Feature for viewing and comparing two trees side-by-side, illustrating matches and differences in topology.
  - **Taxonium:** Noted for scalability and responsiveness when dealing with large phylogenetic trees, using web technology to visualize vast datasets efficiently.

- **Technical Challenges and Developments:**
  - Difficulty and learning curve associated with advanced tree annotation and data integration in ITOL and MicroReact.
  - Need for robust tools during COVID-19 to visualize extensive datasets, prompting optimizations in several tools like Taxonium and Nextstrain.

- **GrapeTree Development:** Initially aimed to be an online minimum spanning tree viewer but can also handle traditional phylogenetic trees. Offers visualization options for complex data with capabilities to collapse branches and annotate clusters.

- **Tool Accessibility and Community Sharing:** Emphasis on free, online, easily accessible tools such as ICTree, ITOL, Taxonium, and others to broaden community engagement and data sharing in microbial bioinformatics.

- **Software Integration:** Mention of ancillary software like Fandango working with broader systems for comprehensive genomic and phylogenetic analysis.

These points highlight the evolving landscape of tools available in microbial bioinformatics, addressing visualization needs from simple tree renderings to complex, interactive views of genome-wide datasets.
