Dr Emma Griffiths and Dr João Carriço join us to give us a crash
course on ontologies, the bioinformatics secret sauce that makes all
things work well.   Microbial genomics data is like the Tower of Babel
with public health talking to food regulators talking to agriculture
talking to veterinarians talking to healthcare, all with different
languages to describe similar things. So how do we get any work done
at all? Listen in to why you need ontologies in your life!
