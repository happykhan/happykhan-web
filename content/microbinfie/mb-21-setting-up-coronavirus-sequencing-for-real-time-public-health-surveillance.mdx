# Interview with Justin O'Grady and Andrew Page

In this interview, we speak with Justin O'Grady and Andrew Page about how to initiate a *SARS-CoV-2* sequencing effort during a pandemic. Their team went on to sequence 1,500 genomes in just two months. The Quadram Institute is one of 16 sequencing centers in the UK that are part of the COVID-19 genome sequencing consortium.

## Key Topics

- **COG-UK Consortium**: The COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium, referred to as COG, plays a crucial role in the sequencing efforts.

- **Contamination Issues**: Challenges faced during sequencing due to contamination and measures taken to mitigate these issues.

- **People**: Highlighting the teamwork and dedication of the individuals involved in the project.

- **Bioinformatics**: The role of bioinformatics in analyzing the massive amount of genomic data.

## Accessing Sequencing Data

If you are interested in accessing the sequencing data produced by Quadram, please check out the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) and the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID).
