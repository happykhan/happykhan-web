In this interview, we speak with [Justin O'Grady](https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/justin-ogrady) and Andrew Page about how to initiate a *SARS-CoV-2* sequencing effort during a pandemic. Their team went on to sequence 1,500 genomes in just two months. The Quadram Institute is one of 16 sequencing centers in the UK that are part of the COVID-19 genome sequencing consortium.

## Guests
* [Justin O'Grady](https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/justin-ogrady)

## Key Topics

- **COG-UK Consortium**: The COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium, referred to as COG, plays a crucial role in the sequencing efforts.

- **Contamination Issues**: Challenges faced during sequencing due to contamination and measures taken to mitigate these issues.

- **People**: Highlighting the teamwork and dedication of the individuals involved in the project.

- **Bioinformatics**: The role of bioinformatics in analyzing the massive amount of genomic data.
