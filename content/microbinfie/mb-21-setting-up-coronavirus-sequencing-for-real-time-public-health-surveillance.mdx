# Interview with Justin O'Grady and Andrew Page

In this interview, we talk with Justin O'Grady and Andrew Page about launching a SARS-CoV-2 sequencing effort during a pandemic and successfully sequencing 1,500 genomes in just two months. The Quadram Institute is one of 16 sequencing centers in the UK, playing a crucial role as part of the COVID-19 genome sequencing consortium.

## Key Topics Discussed:

- **COG (COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium):** An overview of the consortium's objectives and how the Quadram Institute contributes to its mission.
- **Contamination Issues:** Challenges faced in maintaining sample integrity and accuracy during sequencing efforts.
- **The People:** Insights into the team at Quadram Institute and their roles in the sequencing process.
- **Bioinformatics:** The computational methods and tools used for analyzing sequencing data.
