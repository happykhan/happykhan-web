Invasive non-typhoidal *Salmonella* (iNTS) presents a significant public health challenge in Africa. To gain insights into this pressing issue, we spoke with Abdoulie Kanteh and Grant Mackenzie about their research efforts in The Gambia, particularly their use of genomics to understand the serovars in circulation.

## Guests

## Genomic Insights

The work of Kanteh and Mackenzie involves advanced genomic techniques to study the diversity and spread of different *Salmonella* serovars in The Gambia. By employing genomics, they can map out the strains that are prevalent, identify potential outbreaks, and improve public health responses to this invasive pathogen.

For more detailed findings on their research, refer to their manuscript published on bioRxiv: [Access the Manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.18.431831v2)

Their innovative approach plays a crucial role in understanding and controlling the spread of iNTS in Africa and beyond.
