# Invasive Non-typhoidal Salmonella: A Public Health Challenge in Africa

Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) presents a considerable public health challenge across the African continent. Researchers Abdoulie Kanteh and Grant Mackenzie are at the forefront of tackling this issue in The Gambia. Their innovative use of genomics is critical for understanding the diverse serovars of Salmonella currently in circulation, providing insights that could lead to improved interventions and treatments.
