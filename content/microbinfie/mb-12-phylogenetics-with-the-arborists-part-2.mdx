# 12 Phylogenetics with the Arborists Part 2

### Microbial Bioinformatics

In this session, we continue our exploration of phylogenetics with a focus on microbial bioinformatics. Phylogenetics is a crucial tool for understanding evolutionary relationships among organisms, and the skills acquired are invaluable for researchers working with microbial data.

## Key Topics Covered

1. **Advanced Phylogenetic Methods**  
   - Maximum Likelihood Estimation
   - Bayesian Inference
   - Coalescent Theory

2. **Software Tools for Phylogenetics**  
   - RAxML
   - MrBayes
   - BEAST

3. **Case Studies in Microbial Phylogenetics**  
   - Application in Understanding Pathogen Evolution
   - Tracing Transmission Routes through Genetic Data

4. **Data Integration and Analysis**  
   - Handling Large-Scale Genomic Data
   - Combining Genetic and Phenotypic Data

## Learning Objectives

- Develop a deeper understanding of complex phylogenetic methodologies.
- Gain proficiency with leading software tools used in microbial phylogenetics.
- Apply phylogenetic techniques to real-world microbial datasets.
- Interpret and communicate the results of phylogenetic analyses.

## Recommended Resources

- **Books**:  
  - "The Phylogenetic Handbook" by Lemey, Salemi, and Vandamme
  - "Molecular Evolution: A Phylogenetic Approach" by Roderick D.M. Page and Edward C. Holmes

- **Online Courses**:  
  - "Bioinformatics for Beginners" on Coursera
  - "Phylogenomics" by the University of California

- **Research Papers**:  
  - In-depth study on phylogenetic trees and networks
  - Reviews on the evolution of microbial genomes

## Conclusion

This session empowers researchers to not only understand but also apply advanced phylogenetic techniques in microbiology. Whether you're investigating evolutionary paths or tracking disease outbreaks, mastering these tools will significantly enhance your research capabilities.
