In this episode we talk about models of evolution help estimate transitions between states (e.g., nucleotide mutations) and fit the evolutionary patterns to build phylogenetic trees.

## Guests
   * [Dr. Conor Meehan](https://www.ntu.ac.uk/staff-profiles/science-technology/conor-meehan)
   * [Dr. Leo Martins](https://quadram.ac.uk/people/leonardo-de-oliveira-martins/)

## Types of Models
- **Broad Categories**: Models can vary based on:
  - Transition probabilities (e.g., from one nucleotide to another).
  - Covariance among sites (heterogeneity across sites).
  - Specific models discussed include:
    - **CAT Models**: Different implementations for nucleotide or amino acid data.
    - **Gamma-Distributed Models**: Addressing rate variation across sites.
    - **Best Model Selection**: Determined by model testing rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. The best model depends on the dataset.

## Historical Context
- **Model Evolution**: Discussion on the evolution of phylogenetic models, such as DNAML and Fast DNAML, leading to the development of RAxML and other software.

## Specific Models
- **HKY Model**: Favored for its complexity while providing an analytic solution.
- **GTR Model**: Commonly used for complex datasets but can lead to overparameterization.
- **Indel Models**: Need for models that account for insertion/deletion events, like TKF91/92 and Poisson-Indel models, highlighting that many current practices do not include indels in phylogenetic analysis.

## Recombination Challenges
- **Impact of Recombination**: Acknowledgment that recombination complicates tree-building, particularly in recombination-rich species.
- **Recommendations**:
  - Avoid tree building with high recombination data.
  - Consider phylogenetic networks to understand relationships better.
  - Utilize tools like Bacter in a Bayesian framework for more accurate reconstructions.


The best phylogenetic approach should involve careful model selection based on the data, consideration of recombination, and a focus on using models that accurately represent the evolutionary processes at play.
