The microbinfie podcast explores the complexities and challenges of SARS-CoV-2 bioinformatics, drawing from the hosts' extensive experience in sequencing and analyzing viral genomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Over the last year, we've learned a lot about the genomics of *SARS-CoV-2*. Lee extracts all the insider knowledge from our brains, and we give him the honest truth to his probing questions. Here’s what we cover:

- **Pipelines for *SARS-CoV-2***
- **Archives & Metadata**
- **Read Filtering**
- **Assembly vs. Consensus**
- **Amplicon Data Analysis**
- **Controls**
- **If Things Look Too Good**
- **Coverage**

### Key Points

#### 1. Bioinformatics Challenges
- Transitioning from bacterial to viral genome analysis requires specialized approaches
- Amplicon sequencing introduces unique technical complexities
- Every single nucleotide variant (SNP) is critical in SARS-CoV-2 analysis

#### 2. Data Processing Pitfalls
- Careful handling of synthetic primer sequences is essential
- Human read contamination must be systematically removed
- Avoid imputing or filling in missing genome data

#### 3. Recommended Pipelines
- Utilize existing established pipelines instead of creating new ones
- Arctic Network and Tom Connor's Illumina pipelines are preferred
- Multiple tools exist for different sequencing platforms

### Take-Home Messages
- SARS-CoV-2 bioinformatics requires specialized, careful approaches
- Use established pipelines and avoid reinventing existing tools
- Rigorous data preprocessing is crucial for accurate genomic analysis
