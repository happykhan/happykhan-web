# Global Microbial Identifier Conference 13

**Location:** Vancouver, Canada

Andrew and Lee are attending the Global Microbial Identifier Conference 13. During the first day of the conference, they had insightful conversations with:

- **Dr. Finlay Maguire**
- **Dr. Emma Griffiths**

The discussions focused on:

- Microbial Genomics
- Tim Hortons

These topics provided a blend of scientific dialogue and cultural exchange.

### Extra notes

- **Background and Research Focus**:
  - Finlay McGuire, an Assistant Professor at Dalhousie University, has a background in microbiology, with a focus on computational bioinformatics. His research interests include making genomic data usable for clinical decision-making and supporting public health policy through the development of tools.

- **Challenges in Microbial Bioinformatics**:
  - The complexity of operationalizing data sharing principles, as exemplified by WHO initiatives, is a significant challenge.
  - There is a need for integrating various data-sharing models, such as those which exist between GISAID and broader open-sharing frameworks.
  - The agricultural data is often more restricted than human clinical data, posing challenges for cross-sector data sharing.

- **Methodologies and Tools**:
  - Discussion on developing pipelines that incorporate multiple AMR detection tools, emphasizing practical applications such as those implemented in Python.
  - The importance of metadata collection and database integration to make genomic data more practical and actionable.

- **Technical Discussions**:
  - Concerns about global data sharing protocols and the role of specific data structures in microbial genomics.
  - Emphasis on the application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in the epidemiological field, particularly regarding foodborne pathogens.

- **Data Sharing and Collaboration**:
  - WHO's two distinct models for data sharing: a GISAID-like model and the INSTC model, each with differing levels of data access and restrictions.
  - Ongoing discussions about aligning differing cultural expectations between open data and data ownership in genomics.

- **One Health and Interdisciplinary Challenges**:
  - The inclusivity of plant pathogens within the One Health framework due to their similar mechanisms of resistance as antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
  - Issues of redundancies and overlaps in different organizations working in the global microbial identification space.

- **Impact of Next-Generation Sequencing**:
  - The deployment of sequencers through projects like Genome Tracker in the U.S. has placed them years ahead in microbial surveillance capabilities.
  - Discussion on the significance of WGS in driving advancements and formulating protocols like PulseNet for foodborne pathogen tracking.

- **Practical Implementation**:
  - The need for international collaborations to move beyond high-level strategic discussions to practical implementations that can be directly applied in field contexts.


The guest speakers on the microbial bioinformatics podcast include Finlay McGuire, an Assistant Professor at Dalhousie University in Computer Science and Epidemiology, and Pathogenomics Bioinformatics Lead for the Sheriff Hospital Lab.
