The microbinfie podcast explores **Pathoplexus**, an innovative platform designed to facilitate viral genome data sharing while addressing researchers' concerns about publication credit and data accessibility.

Nabil and Lee bring a guest host Clint to talk with some of the people behind Pathoplexus http://pathoplexus.org/ 

### Key Points

#### 1. Pathoplexus Platform
- Virus genome database allowing researchers to share sequences
- Supports both open and restricted-use data sharing models
- Provides immediate pre-processing of uploaded sequences using tools like Nextclade

#### 2. Data Sharing Innovation
- Addresses researchers' fear of being "scooped" through restricted-use option
- Allows public health use of sequences before publication
- Supports aggregate analysis while protecting individual researchers' interests

#### 3. Community-Driven Development
- Currently hosts genomic data for viruses like Ebola, West Nile, mPox, RSV
- Selects new pathogens based on community input and public health needs
- Implements innovative citation tracking through sequence set DOIs

### Take-Home Messages
- Pathoplexus revolutionizes viral genomic data sharing
- Balances open science with researchers' publication concerns
- Provides flexible, community-responsive platform for pathogen genomics
