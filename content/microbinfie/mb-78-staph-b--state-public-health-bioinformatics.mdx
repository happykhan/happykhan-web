# Bioinformatics in Public Health: A Dive into StaPH-B and the Cecret Pipeline

## Introduction

Dr. Erin Young and Dr. Kelsey Florek join us to discuss StaPH-B, a US state public health bioinformatics group, and provide insights into the popular SARS-CoV-2 pipeline, Cecret. For more information, you can visit the [StaPH-B Website](https://staphb.org/) and the [Cecret Pipeline GitHub Repository](https://github.com/CDCgov/SC2CLIA).

## About StaPH-B

Dr. Kelsey Florek explains that StaPH-B was formed to facilitate collaboration among bioinformaticians in state public health laboratories, particularly those new to sequencing and data interpretation. StaPH-B acts as a conduit for communication and expertise across various laboratories, benefiting projects funded by the NIH, CDC, and other agencies.

### Membership and Resources

Dr. Erin Young highlights StaPH-B's diverse membership, offering various learning opportunities. The organization utilizes a Slack workspace with nearly 400 members and over 50 channels focused on different bioinformatics activities. This platform serves as a valuable resource for bioinformaticians seeking answers, guidance, and ideas.

## Who Can Join

Initially founded for state public health bioinformaticians, StaPH-B is open to everyone, focusing on state public health activities. Kelsey mentions that the community has achieved significant milestones, including successful collaborations on GitHub, Docker, and workflow processes. The Slack workspace stands out as a critical resource.

### Training and Toolkit

Erin talks about StaPH-B's training activities, which include the Staph-B Toolkit, training sessions, and educational videos to ensure the widespread sharing of knowledge and expertise.

## The Cecret Pipeline

The conversation shifts to the Cecret pipeline, an initiative spearheaded by Dr. Erin Young during the pandemic. Developed for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing, Cecret employs the Arctic group's protocol for Nanopore sequencing but was adapted to work with Illumina-based sequencing, which is more efficient on the MiSeq platform. The pipeline uses BWA as the default aligner, tailored for viral sequencing with a reliable reference.

### Resources and Tutorials

Erin recommends reviewing the SEQret pipeline tutorials and the monthly StaPH-B videos for those entering the field. These resources highlight various state laboratory projects and provide guidance for beginners.

## Bioinformatics Workflows

In a previous discussion, the speakers elaborated on the evolution of COVID genome analysis workflows. These workflows, including Secret, NF Core, Monro, and Next Flow Optic Pipeline, have evolved due to the growing data volumes. Erin shared her initial apprehension about sharing her workflow publicly and her meticulous tracking of repository forks to ensure scientific integrity.

### Evolution and Meaning

The Secret workflow has gradually improved with fewer bugs, retaining its original name inspired by a significant hiking landmark in Northern Utah. This symbolizes the importance of managing COVID data effectively and linking it to public health efforts.

## Conclusion

StaPH-B and workflows like Secret play vital roles in bioinformatics and COVID genome analysis. These collaborations and resources are crucial in disseminating knowledge and expertise across laboratories, enabling the successful execution of projects supported by the NIH, CDC, and other grant-giving bodies.

### Extra notes

- **STAFFB**: The State Public Health Bioinformatics Workgroup (STAFFB) was founded to enhance collaboration among bioinformaticians in state public health labs. It facilitates communication through a Slack channel, sharing expertise and providing resources to address challenges and implement new sequencing methods.

- **Platform Independence**: The Arctic group's SARS-CoV-2 sequencing protocol, initially nanopore-based, was adapted to the Illumina platform due to setup constraints at certain public health labs, highlighting the importance of platform-independent workflows.

- **SeqCOVID Pipeline**: Developed by adapting the Arctic primers for Illumina sequencing, addressing the lack of an initial workflow suitable for this platform in public health laboratories. It utilizes BWA as the default aligner and includes multiple aligner options due to early challenges with mutation handling.

- **Feature Creep**: The evolution from basic QC metrics to a more complex workflow with legacy features indicates the iterative nature of bioinformatics tool development. The community-driven development process led to the inclusion of redundant features.

- **Workflow Adoption**: Although initial workflows had niche users, more popular alternatives like NF Core's ViralRecon and Titan by Theogen have emerged, showcasing the transition as workflows mature and requirements evolve.

- **Community & Training**: The Slack Workgroup and GitHub initiatives facilitate collaborative workflow development, fostering contributions to Docker projects and command-line training that benefit public health informatics.

- **Resource Utilization**: State public health laboratories leverage STAFFB resources to manage data workflows, adapting to significant increases in sequencing capacities from high-profile CDC projects. 

- **Data Management Challenges**: Rapid expansion in sequencing obligations has necessitated new strategies for running workflows and managing data output efficiently.

- **Knowledge Sharing**: Open communication channels and community resources are crucial for navigating rapid changes in the field, particularly during events demanding fast workflow adaptation like the COVID-19 pandemic.

- **Bioinformatics Opportunities**: For aspiring and current bioinformaticians, engaging with resources like STAFFB Slack and GitHub offers valuable networking, learning, and collaborative opportunities to address both current and future public health challenges.
