In this episode of the Micro Binfie podcast, host Andrew Page is live
from the 10th Microbial Bioinformatics Hackathon in Bethesda,
Maryland. He sits down with David Mahoney, a PhD student from
Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. David shares his
research on characterizing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and
their transfer within metagenomes, focusing on metagenomic assembly
graphs.  They delve into David’s background in food safety
microbiology and his interest in the public health implications of
genomics. He explains his exciting work on analyzing how AMR genes
transfer across different environments, such as food production plants
and clinical settings, using both new and existing data from Canada’s
Genomics Research and Development Initiative.  David also highlights
his use of innovative methods like assembly graphs and graph-based
approaches to uncover AMR gene flow and lateral gene transfers,
including the potential of machine learning techniques such as graph
convolutional neural networks.
