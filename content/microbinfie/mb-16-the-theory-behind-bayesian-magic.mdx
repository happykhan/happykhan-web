### What is Bayesian Inference?
- **Definition**: Bayesian inference is a mathematical framework based on conditional probabilities, used for hypothesis testing.
- **Comparison**: It contrasts with maximum likelihood methods, focusing on integrating multiple data sources.

### Importance of Bayesian Models in Phylogenetics
- **Integration of Data**: Bayesian models allow for the incorporation of various data inputs, known as priors, such as:
  - Evolutionary models.
  - Sequence alignments.
  - Sample metadata (e.g., time and location).
- **Phylogenetic Trees**: Trees are treated as parameters within Bayesian models, which allows for more complex analyses.

### Key Concepts
- **Priors and Posteriors**:
  - **Prior**: The initial belief about parameters before analyzing data (e.g., expectations about tree structures).
  - **Posterior**: The updated belief after incorporating data, reflecting the likelihood of the model given the observed data.
- **Uncertainty**: Bayesian inference emphasizes the uncertainty in variable distributions and integrates this into the analysis from the beginning.

### Advantages of Bayesian Models
- **Statistical Support**: Bayesian processes provide statistical support for phylogenetic conclusions as part of the analysis, unlike maximum likelihood methods that require separate bootstrapping for support assessment.
- **Complexity Handling**: Bayesian models can address complex scenarios, including when trees are a variable in the model, providing a more nuanced understanding of evolutionary relationships.
