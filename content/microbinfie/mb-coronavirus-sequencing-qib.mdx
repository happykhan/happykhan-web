We chat to Justin O'Grady and Andrew Page on how to get a SARS-CoV-2
sequencing effort off the ground in the middle of a pandemic and go on
to sequence 1,500 genomes in 2 months. The Quadram institute is one of
16 sequencing centres in the UK which are part of the COVID-19 genome
sequencing consortium. Things we touch off include COG, contamination
issues, the people, and bioinformatics.  Further information from:
https://www.cogconsortium.uk/ If you want to access the sequencing
data produced by Quadram, please checkout the ENA and GISAID.
