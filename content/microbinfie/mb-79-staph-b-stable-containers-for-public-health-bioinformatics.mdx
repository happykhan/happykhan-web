The microbinfie podcast explores the StaPH-B Docker repository and toolkit, highlighting innovative approaches to simplifying bioinformatics workflows for public health laboratories through containerization technology.

Dr. Erin Young from the Utah Department of Health and Dr. Kelsey Florek from the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene join us to discuss StaPH-B containers for public health bioinformatics. It's essentially about making biology easier for everyone!

## About StaPH-B

StaPH-B, which stands for State Public Health Bioinformatics, is a collaborative effort to streamline and enhance bioinformatics workflows in the realm of public health. The use of StaPH-B containers can significantly simplify the complex processes involved in bioinformatics, making these advanced scientific techniques more accessible to public health professionals.

### Key Features of StaPH-B:

- Containerized workflows that facilitate easier deployment and sharing of bioinformatics tools.
- Focus on public health applications, addressing the unique needs and challenges faced by state health laboratories.
- An open-source community that encourages collaboration and sharing of resources among public health laboratories.

You can explore more about StaPH-B and access their resources on GitHub: [StaPH-B GitHub Repository](https://github.com/StaPH-B).
