This podcast explores the evolving landscape of species identification, especially as genomic tools like ANI become central to understanding microbial diversity.
For more information, please visit Konstantinidis lab website, [enve-omics.gatech.edu](https://enve-omics.gatech.edu/). 

Here are the key points from the podcast introduction and initial conversation:

1. **Guest: Kostas Konstantinidis**:
   - **Background**: Kostas is originally from Greece, with academic roots in agricultural sciences, and a PhD from Michigan State, working on microbial genomics.
   - **Career Path**: Transitioned from plant protection to studying soil microbiology, focusing on metagenomics and comparative genomics. This led to his involvement in developing Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) for species delineation.
   - **ANI Development**: ANI emerged as a tool during his PhD to resolve the limitations of traditional methods (like 16S rRNA gene sequencing) in distinguishing closely related species.
   - **Metagenomics Postdoc**: Following his PhD, he did a postdoc with Ed DeLong at MIT, specializing in environmental metagenomics.

2. **ANI and Species Delineation**:
   - ANI is now widely used for defining species in genomics.
   - There is a natural ANI gap (~85-95%) that often helps in distinguishing species, making ANI a reliable metric for species identification in genomics.
   - **Challenges with Taxonomy**: Classic species designations (like *Shigella* vs. *E. coli*) are sometimes inconsistent with genomic data, where very closely related organisms may have distinct clinical or phenotypic traits.

3. **Genomic vs. Clinical Taxonomy**:
   - There is a difference between academic/genomic taxonomy (based on ANI and genetic data) and clinical taxonomy (based on phenotypic or diagnostic criteria).
   - While genomics suggests reclassifying some species, like *Shigella* as *E. coli*, clinical significance justifies maintaining distinct names in some cases.

4. **Future of Taxonomy**:
   - The discussion highlighted the challenge of uniting traditional and genomic taxonomy, especially with medically important bacteria.
   - Systems like **C-Code** are emerging to name uncultivated taxa based on genomic data, addressing gaps in the current naming conventions. This is especially relevant in metagenomics.

5. **Communication Gaps**:
   - There is a need for better dialogue between clinical microbiologists and taxonomists/ecologists to reconcile discrepancies between traditional and genomic species definitions. 

6. **Closing**:
   - The podcast is available on various platforms, and listeners are encouraged to follow for more engaging conversations on microbial bioinformatics.
