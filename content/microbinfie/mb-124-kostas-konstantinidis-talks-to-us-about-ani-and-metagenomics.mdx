This podcast explores the evolving landscape of species identification, especially as genomic tools like ANI become central to understanding microbial diversity.

Here are the key points from the podcast introduction and initial conversation:

1. **Guest: Kostas Konstantinidis**:
   - **Background**: Kostas is originally from Greece, with academic roots in agricultural sciences, and a PhD from Michigan State, working on microbial genomics.
   - **Career Path**: Transitioned from plant protection to studying soil microbiology, focusing on metagenomics and comparative genomics. This led to his involvement in developing Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) for species delineation.
   - **ANI Development**: ANI emerged as a tool during his PhD to resolve the limitations of traditional methods (like 16S rRNA gene sequencing) in distinguishing closely related species.
   - **Metagenomics Postdoc**: Following his PhD, he did a postdoc with Ed DeLong at MIT, specializing in environmental metagenomics.

2. **ANI and Species Delineation**:
   - ANI is now widely used for defining species in genomics.
   - There is a natural ANI gap (~85-95%) that often helps in distinguishing species, making ANI a reliable metric for species identification in genomics.
   - **Challenges with Taxonomy**: Classic species designations (like *Shigella* vs. *E. coli*) are sometimes inconsistent with genomic data, where very closely related organisms may have distinct clinical or phenotypic traits.

3. **Genomic vs. Clinical Taxonomy**:
   - There is a difference between academic/genomic taxonomy (based on ANI and genetic data) and clinical taxonomy (based on phenotypic or diagnostic criteria).
   - While genomics suggests reclassifying some species, like *Shigella* as *E. coli*, clinical significance justifies maintaining distinct names in some cases.

4. **Future of Taxonomy**:
   - The discussion highlighted the challenge of uniting traditional and genomic taxonomy, especially with medically important bacteria.
   - Systems like **C-Code** are emerging to name uncultivated taxa based on genomic data, addressing gaps in the current naming conventions. This is especially relevant in metagenomics.

5. **Communication Gaps**:
   - There is a need for better dialogue between clinical microbiologists and taxonomists/ecologists to reconcile discrepancies between traditional and genomic species definitions. 

6. **Closing**:
   - The podcast is available on various platforms, and listeners are encouraged to follow for more engaging conversations on microbial bioinformatics.
