## Additional summary:

- **ANI and Species Definition:** The Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) is emphasized as a critical metric for defining microbial species, showing a gap in diversity between 85%-95% ANI when comparing genomes. This supports using 95% ANI as a proxy for species differentiation, although variations can occur, suggesting the use of natural diversity patterns to refine this metric.

- **Challenges with Classical Taxonomies:** There is a recognized discrepancy between classical species definitions based on phenotypic characteristics and modern genomic insights, exemplified by cases like Shigella and E. coli. The genomic similarity often contradicts traditional classifications, suggesting potential renaming while maintaining diagnostic distinctions for clinical relevance.

- **Modern Taxonomy Efforts:** Tools like GTDB (Genome Taxonomy Database) use A&I to redefine species boundaries. This sometimes conflicts with existing taxonomies, necessitating discussions on how to integrate genomic data into microbial classification systems.

- **Strain Resolution Using Genomic Tools:** Emphasis is placed on leveraging genomic tools to identify natural clusters and resolve clades and subclades within species, offering better resolution than older methods.

- **SeekCode and Uncultivated Taxa:** SeekCode addresses the issue of naming and classifying uncultivated taxa, which are not recognized by traditional systems like ICNP. The initiative advocates for using genome sequences as type material for taxonomy, challenging traditional requirements for cultured specimens.

- **Communication Challenges:** There is a notable communication gap between ecological and clinical microbiologists, with separate journals and taxonomies. Emphasizing improved communication could harmonize taxonomic practices across disciplines.

- **Bioinformatics Tools and Projects:** The role of SeekCode in providing stable names for uncultivated species illustrates the ongoing evolution of microbial bioinformatics tools to accommodate genomic-era challenges.

The discussion highlights the dynamic nature of microbial bioinformatics, where genomic data increasingly shapes species definitions and taxonomic practices.
