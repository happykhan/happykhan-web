Andrew talks to Niamh Tumelty from the University of Cambridge about
SARS-CoV-2 'new variants' and tries to clear up some of the confusion
around all the names flying around. Hopefully this helps to give some
insights into the various names you hear, but probably by the time you
listen the whole thing will have changed again since this field moves
so rapidly. Andrew apologises in advance for all the errors that will
be found in this podcast!  If you want to read a bit more theres an
interesting news item on Nature:
