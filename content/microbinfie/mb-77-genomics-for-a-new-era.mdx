# Exciting Developments in Comparative Genomics

Today, we’re discussing some exciting new developments in the area of comparative genomics. We are joined by Dr. Zamin Iqbal, a Research Group Leader at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and Dr. Grace Blackwell, who is jointly affiliated with the European Bioinformatics Institute, working in Dr. Zamin Iqbal's group, as well as in Nick Thomson’s team at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.

Comparative genomics is a fascinating field that involves comparing the genomes of different species to understand their evolutionary relationships, functional biology, and genetic diversity. This field plays a crucial role in numerous scientific and medical advancements, making these developments particularly impactful.

Stay tuned as we dive deeper into the insights and breakthroughs shared by Dr. Iqbal and Dr. Blackwell.
