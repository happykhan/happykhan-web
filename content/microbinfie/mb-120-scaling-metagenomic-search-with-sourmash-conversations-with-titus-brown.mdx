title: 'Episode 120: Scaling Metagenomic Search with Sourmash - Conversations with Titus Brown'
transcript: /microbinfie-transcripts/episode-120.txt
---

In this final episode, our conversation with Titus Brown centers on his groundbreaking work in scaling metagenomic search using *Sourmash*. Here's an overview of the key topics discussed:

## Sourmash Overview

- **Sketching and Comparing Large k-mer Datasets**: *Sourmash* facilitates the representation and comparison of extensive k-mer datasets, essential for metagenomic analysis.

- **Sampling Approach**: This method enables innovative analyses, such as containment estimation, which allows researchers to determine the presence of sequence data within larger datasets.

## Branchwater and Scaling

- **Branchwater Tool**: The discussion highlights the exciting capabilities of the *Branchwater* tool for executing multi-threaded real-time searches of sequence read archives (SRA).

- **Scaling with WebAssembly**: Techniques leveraging WebAssembly allow for searching across millions of metagenomes in mere seconds, showcasing significant advancements in data retrieval speed and efficiency.

## Public Health Applications

- **Pathogen Tracking and Sourcing**: There is potential for using *Sourmash* in public health to track and identify the sources of pathogens swiftly.

## Caveats and Limitations

- **Resolution Limits**: Important caveats regarding the method's resolution limits are outlined, stressing the necessity for follow-up analyses to corroborate initial findings.

- **Specificity and Sensitivity**: Ongoing work aims to characterize the specificity and sensitivity of these techniques, ensuring accurate and reliable applications.

This episode underscores the significant scalability *Sourmash* brings to metagenomic search and the potential applications in public health. At the same time, it acknowledges the current limitations and uncertainties in the field. Titus emphasizes the importance of clearly communicating the capabilities and limitations of bioinformatic tools as research evolves.
