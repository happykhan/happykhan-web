Mark Pallen explains how exciting it was to be in microbial
bioinformatics around the turn of the millennium, as we gained genomes
for the first time from model organisms and fearsome pathogens. He
recounts working with his hero David Relman on the genome sequencing
of the strange slow-growing organism called Tropheryma whipplei in
competition with a French team.   Mark moved to Belfast in late 1999
collaborating with another Englishman working on the island of
Ireland, Tim Foster in Dublin. Pallen describes the addictive
exhilaration of using PSI-BLAST to find new sortases and sortase
substrates across a range of new genomesâ€”for him this was the
bioinformatics equivalent of crack cocaine. He quotes the philosopher
Alfred North Whitehead in saying that the goal of every scientist is
to seek simplicity but distrust it. What Mark found was that in most
organisms sortases were behaving quite differently from the rather
simple scenario seen in Staphylococcus aureus. He made similar
observations on the WXG100 proteins and type VII secretion, which he
found in many new contexts quite different from the original context
of ESAT-6 as an antigen in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mark makes
clear that we still don't really fully understand the role of ESAT-6
twenty years on.   The focus of Pallen's work then shifted to E. coli,
where he described vestigial gene clusters for non-functional type III
secretion systems in this model organism. He came to realize that E.
coli K-12 was not handed to microbiologist by God as a model organism
but was just another strain of E. coli and nothing special. Many of
the earliest genomes to be sequenced came from worn-out lab strains.
To counter this problem, Gordon Dougan at the Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute moved the focus to genome-sequencing freshly isolated
minimally passaged isolates. With Brendan Wren, Pallen wrote a review
article for nature, emphasizing the importance of adopting an eco-evo
perspective when trying to interpret bacterial genomes.   Around that
time, Scott Beatson joined Pallen's group. Mark managed to persuade
Scott to work on type III secretion in E. coli rather than Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. The result was the discovery of dozens of new type III
secretion effectors, tying together bioinformatics and lab work to
culminate in a PNAS paper.  References
