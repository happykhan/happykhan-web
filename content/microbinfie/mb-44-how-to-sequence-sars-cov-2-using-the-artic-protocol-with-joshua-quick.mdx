In this episode of the microbinfie podcast, Joshua Quick from the University of Birmingham provides an in-depth exploration of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing using the ARTIC protocol, highlighting the critical techniques and challenges in viral genome analysis during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Joshua Quick from the University of Birmingham presented on the topic **"How to Sequence SARS-CoV-2 Using the ARTIC Protocol"** during a workshop. This event was a collaborative effort between the **ARTIC Network** and **CLIMB-BIG-DATA** focused on COVID-19 data analysis. The session was chaired by Nick Loman.

### Key Concepts

- **SARS-CoV-2**: The virus responsible for COVID-19.
- **ARTIC Protocol**: A widely used protocol for sequencing SARS-CoV-2.
- **Sequencing**: A method used to determine the genetic sequence of an organism.
- **COVID-19 Data Analysis**: Involves analyzing viral genetic sequences to track mutation and transmission. 

The workshop aimed at equipping researchers with protocol knowledge to enhance their understanding and ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 efficiently.

### Extra notes

- The podcast discusses the use of *amplicon sequencing*, particularly the *ARTIC method*, which is economical and scalable for recovering genomes even with high host levels.

- The *multiplex PCR* technique is highlighted as it allows the generation of multiple amplicons in a single reaction, which is essential for high-throughput sequencing needs.

- The *Primal Scheme* is a web-based tool developed for designing primers for multiplex PCR. Users can upload a FASTA file of references to design suitable primers for diverse viral genomes.

- The tool uses *Parasail* for aligning references and selecting conserved primers and allows for adjustments to design primers against specific reference genomes.

- The technique allows the production of 96 amplicons in two reactions covering approximately 30,000 base pair genomes, with high plexity managed through primer efficiency and overlaps.

- Amplification dropouts, which result in no data for specific genome regions, are a noted challenge and can occur due to poor primers or mutations in the primer binding site.

- The protocol initially developed for *SARS-CoV-2* showed early challenges in primer dropouts, prompting refinements for improved consistency.

- The *Primal Scheme* tool's success rate improves significantly with diverse genomes due to a multi-alignment approach, although there are limits with highly diverse sets.

- Native barcoding protocols are preferred for high specificity in demultiplexing, necessary due to amplicon dropouts and avoiding cross-sample contamination.

- High GC content in bacterial genomes presents additional challenges in primer design. A high GC mode is available in *Primal Scheme* to adjust parameters suitable for such genomic contexts.

- Different commercialization acts include support and products provided by organizations like *ONT*, *QIAGEN*, and *Illumina* based on these PCR primers.

- The use of the direct RNA kit for sequencing is limited due to high input requirements and the necessity for polyadenylation in non-polyadenylated viruses, reducing practical utility in clinical settings.

- The discussion includes managing equimolar pools and balancing pools for improved genome completeness, with techniques available on *protocols.io* for calculating primer weighting based on coverage.

- The importance of stringent demultiplexing is emphasized to prevent cross-sample contamination leading to incorrect variant calling.
