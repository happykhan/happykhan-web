# MicroBinfie Podcast Episode: Exploring WDL with Andrew Sevinsky and Danny J. Park

Today on the [MicroBinfie podcast](https://twitter.com/microbinfie), Andrew Sevinsky and Danny J. Park join us to discuss the Workflow Description Language (WDL). We delve into what "widdle" means to Andrew and his kids, and Joel offers his unique take on Lyve-SET. Spoiler: you won't believe what happens next!

## Key Highlights

### Understanding WDL

The episode highlights the use of WDL to describe bioinformatics pipelines in a portable and cross-environment way. Here's what you need to know:

- **Assumption of Containerization:** The conversation starts with the assumption that tools are already containerized, allowing WDL to effectively bind them together.
- **Standardization and Reproducibility:** WDL helps standardize bioinformatics, making it more reproducible and scalable. This reduces the CIS admin workload, giving researchers more time to focus on scientific inquiries.
- **Unique Features:** While many workflow languages exist, WDL stands out due to its formal specification and orthogonality to common implementations.

### Workflow Languages and Public Health Bioinformatics

Joel and Danny explore:

- **Challenges:** Discussion on version control and quality management and its impact on bioinformatics.
- **Community Involvement:** Origins of StaphB, a community of state-level public health bioinformaticians, aiming to bridge academic and public health department challenges.

### Personal Stories and Language Choice

- **Danny's Journey with WDL:** Danny shares how they concluded that WDL was perfect for pipeline portability.
- **Joel's Experience:** Joel discusses choosing WDL for its applicability to public health and support from its creators, notably the Broad Institute.

### Conclusion

The podcast wraps up with a focus on the crucial role of workflow languages, such as WDL, in connecting bioinformatics with public health. The final consensus is that the choice of workflow language should depend on the environment and needs. Both guests express their strong support for WDL and its impact in streamlining bioinformatics workflows.
