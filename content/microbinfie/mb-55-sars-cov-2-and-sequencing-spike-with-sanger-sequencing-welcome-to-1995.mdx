# New Method for Identifying Variants of Concern Using Sanger Sequencing

Today, we're exploring a novel method for identifying variants of concern by utilizing Sanger sequencing. We're joined by two of the authors of this groundbreaking method, Kai Blin and Tue Jorgensen, both of whom are affiliated with the Technical University of Denmark.
