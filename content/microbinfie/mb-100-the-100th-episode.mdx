# Celebrating 100 Episodes!

We are thrilled to celebrate reaching 100 episodes of our podcast! We've taken this opportunity to look back at the history of our podcast and to discuss what the future might hold.

## Episode Highlights

- **Retrospective**: Reflecting on our journey from episode 1 to this milestone episode, we've seen significant growth and change.
  
- **Future Plans**: We shared our hopes and plans for the upcoming episodes, including new topics, guests, and formats that we are excited to explore.

- **Fun Segment**: In a lighthearted twist, Lee got his revenge by challenging Andrew and Nabil to pronounce words that are local to his region.

## Mentioned Resources

- **Research Paper**: We very briefly touched on this interesting paper during our episode. Check it out for more details: [Nature Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x).
  
- **Phage Database**: Nabil was trying to remember a particular site, which he recalled post-recording. Here it is for those interested: [PhagesDB](https://phagesdb.org/phages/).

Thank you to all our listeners for your support throughout our journey to 100 episodes. We couldn't have done it without you, and we're excited for the journey ahead!

The guest speakers on the MicroBinfeed podcast are Dr. Nabil Ali Khan, Dr. Andrew Page, and Dr. Lee Katz.
