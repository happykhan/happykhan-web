In this special episode, we celebrate reaching the milestone of 100 episodes! We reflect on the fascinating journey of our podcast, discussing its history and exploring what the future might hold.

## Highlights

- **History Review:** We take a nostalgic look back at the origins and evolution of our podcast, revisiting some memorable episodes and moments.
- **Future Prospects:** Our discussion turns to the future, where we share our hopes, plans, and what listeners might expect in the episodes to come.

## Special Segment: Local Word Challenge

As a fun twist, Lee gets his revenge by challenging Andrew and Nabil to pronounce words that are local to his region. Listen in for some humorous attempts and learning moments.

## Mentioned Resources

- **Scientific Paper:** During the episode, we very briefly mention a fascinating scientific paper titled "A phage therapy CDR-h3 epitope dataset" published in *Nature*. You can read more about it [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x).

- **Phage Database:** Nabil recalled a particular site after the recording, which is an excellent resource for phage information. Check out [PhagesDB](https://phagesdb.org/phages/) for more information.

Thank you to all our listeners for joining us on this journey. Here's to the next 100 episodes! 🥳
