# Celebrating 100 Episodes!

In this special episode, we celebrate reaching the milestone of 100 episodes! We reflect on the fascinating journey of our podcast, discussing its history and exploring what the future might hold.

## Highlights

- **History Review:** We take a nostalgic look back at the origins and evolution of our podcast, revisiting some memorable episodes and moments.
- **Future Prospects:** Our discussion turns to the future, where we share our hopes, plans, and what listeners might expect in the episodes to come.

## Special Segment: Local Word Challenge

As a fun twist, Lee gets his revenge by challenging Andrew and Nabil to pronounce words that are local to his region. Listen in for some humorous attempts and learning moments.

## Mentioned Resources

- **Scientific Paper:** During the episode, we very briefly mention a fascinating scientific paper titled "A phage therapy CDR-h3 epitope dataset" published in *Nature*. You can read more about it [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x).

- **Phage Database:** Nabil recalled a particular site after the recording, which is an excellent resource for phage information. Check out [PhagesDB](https://phagesdb.org/phages/) for more information.

Thank you to all our listeners for joining us on this journey. Here's to the next 100 episodes! 🥳
