# Global Microbial Identifier Conference (GMI13)

**Location:** Vancouver, Canada

**Day 3 Update:**

On the third day of the Global Microbial Identifier Conference (GMI13), we had the opportunity to catch up with Dr. Ruth Timme. 

Stay tuned for more insights and updates from the conference!

### Extra notes

- **Genome Tracker Program:** The program focuses on genomic epidemiology for foodborne pathogens, depositing numerous pathogen data into the public domain for research and tracking.

- **Standardizing Genomic Data Submission:** The idea of creating a pathogen data object model (DOM) to structure and standardize submission and storage of whole genome sequence data for pathogens in the INSDC, making it easier for submitters and users to access the data.

- **Existing Challenges in Data Submission:** Previously, there were multiple ways to submit pathogen genomes to INSDC, which caused confusion. In the virus domain, specifically, there has been inconsistency, such as a lack of associated biosamples with viral genome records.

- **Technical and Administrative Harmonization:** There's an effort to harmonize standards across different institutions and countries to improve data submission and retrieval processes.

- **International Collaboration:** There's cooperation with international entities like PAGE, CDC, and USDA to ensure standardized data submission processes are internationally adopted.

- **Differentiation of Roles:** There's a distinction between technical work (such as the development of standards) which is done by groups like phage, and political or administrative roles to facilitate adoption across governments (potentially GMI's role).

- **Role and Impact of Organizations:** Organizations like Phage focus on creating practical tools and specifications, while GMI might function as a political subgroup, fostering global cooperation and discussion on implementing bioinformatics standards.

- **Technical Standards in Virus Data:** Challenges encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic due to non-standardized submission methods highlight the need for unified standards, such as consistent use of biosamples with genomic data.

This podcast emphasizes the importance of standardized methodologies in microbial bioinformatics, the ongoing efforts to implement these standards, and the challenges involved in bridging technical and administrative gaps globally.

The guest speakers on the Microbial Bioinformatics podcast in the provided transcript include Dr. Lee Katz, Dr. Nabil Ali Khan, Professor Andrew Page, and Ruth Timme.
