# Mark Pallen's Journey in Microbial Bioinformatics

Mark Pallen describes the thrilling era of microbial bioinformatics around the turn of the millennium. It was a time when genomes from model organisms and dangerous pathogens were being sequenced for the first time. Pallen shares his experiences collaborating with his hero, David Relman, on sequencing the genome of the odd, slow-growing organism Tropheryma whipplei, while competing with a French team.

## A New Chapter in Belfast

In late 1999, Mark Pallen moved to Belfast and began collaborating with Tim Foster, an Englishman based in Dublin, Ireland. During this period, Pallen was captivated by the use of PSI-BLAST to discover new sortases and sortase substrates across emerging genomes. He likened this exhilarating process to the 'bioinformatics equivalent of crack cocaine'.

Pallen, echoing the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, strives for simplicity while maintaining a healthy skepticism towards it. His work revealed that, in many organisms, sortases behaved differently than in the straightforward scenario observed in *Staphylococcus aureus*. He made similar discoveries regarding WXG100 proteins and type VII secretion, encountering them in diverse contexts beyond the original setting of ESAT-6 as an antigen in *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Pallen notes that even twenty years later, the role of ESAT-6 is not fully understood.

## A Shift to E. coli

Pallen's research focus then shifted to *E. coli*, where he uncovered vestigial gene clusters for non-functional type III secretion systems in this model organism. He realized that *E. coli* K-12 wasn't divinely ordained as a model organism but was simply another strain of *E. coli*. Many of the earliest sequenced genomes originated from overused lab strains. To address this, Gordon Dougan at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute began focusing on sequencing genomes from freshly isolated, minimally passaged samples. Together with Brendan Wren, Pallen wrote a review article for Nature, emphasizing the importance of adopting an ecological and evolutionary perspective (eco-evo perspective) when interpreting bacterial genomes.

## Discoveries in Type III Secretion Systems

Around this time, Scott Beatson joined Pallen's research group. Pallen successfully convinced Beatson to work on type III secretion in *E. coli* instead of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. This collaboration led to the discovery of numerous new type III secretion effectors, combining bioinformatics with laboratory research and culminating in a publication in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

### Extra notes

- The early 21st century was a transformative time in microbial bioinformatics due to the advent of genome sequencing, revealing previously undiscovered genes even in well-studied organisms like E. coli.

- Professor Mark Pallant's work involved genome sequencing projects for various bacteria, including Campylobacter and Tropheryma whipplei, which posed unique challenges like growing enough biomass for DNA sequencing.

- The collaboration with Didier Raoul's team in France highlighted international complexities in genomic projects. Raoul's contributions to science, despite controversies, include advancing the study of giant viruses and inventing Culturomics.

- Homology searching became a significant methodology, allowing scientists to analyze new genomes and discover gene functions through sequence similarities, leading to insights in microbial evolution and physiology.

- The use of CyBLAST, an iterative homology search tool, enabled in-depth genome mining, which was instrumental in identifying new SORTASE substrates in Staphylococcus aureus, revealing their clustering in gene clusters, and their role in forming fimbrial structures.

- The concept of reverse vaccinology emerged from bioinformatics studies, allowing predictions of vaccine targets based on genome sequencing. However, the functions of some identified proteins, such as those in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remain unclear.

- Research on E. coli revealed surprising genomic features, such as a degenerated type 3 secretion system, ETT2, prevalent across strains yet non-functional, challenging assumptions about model organisms like E. coli K12.

- Sequencing efforts underscored the importance of considering evolutionary and ecological contexts, advocating for sequencing fresh, wild-type strains to better represent natural genetic diversity as opposed to lab-adapted strains.

- Advances in bioinformatics allowed for the discovery and validation of numerous new bacterial effectors linked to type 3 secretion systems, integrating computational predictions with experimental validation, exemplifying the synergy between bioinformatics and laboratory work.

The speakers on the Microbial Bioinformatics podcast include Dr. Lee Katz, Dr. Nabil Ali Khan, and Dr. Andrew Page as the hosts, with Professor Mark Pallant as a guest speaker.
