# StaPH-B Containers for Public Health Bioinformatics

Dr. Erin Young from the Utah Department of Health and Dr. Kelsey Florek from the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene join us to discuss StaPH-B containers for public health bioinformatics. It's essentially about making biology easier for everyone!

## About StaPH-B

StaPH-B, which stands for State Public Health Bioinformatics, is a collaborative effort to streamline and enhance bioinformatics workflows in the realm of public health. The use of StaPH-B containers can significantly simplify the complex processes involved in bioinformatics, making these advanced scientific techniques more accessible to public health professionals.

### Key Features of StaPH-B:

- Containerized workflows that facilitate easier deployment and sharing of bioinformatics tools.
- Focus on public health applications, addressing the unique needs and challenges faced by state health laboratories.
- An open-source community that encourages collaboration and sharing of resources among public health laboratories.

You can explore more about StaPH-B and access their resources on GitHub: [StaPH-B GitHub Repository](https://github.com/StaPH-B).
