We chat with the authors of CoronaHiT which lets you sequence up to 94
SARS-CoV-2 samples on a single MinION flowcell. This reduces the cost
of sequencing 3-fold, with a simpler, faster protocol. Justin O'Grady
and David Baker join Andrew Page and Nabil-Fareed Alikhan to chat
about how it all works, how it came into being and why its awesome.
