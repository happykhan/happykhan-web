# Systematics and SeqCode: A Nomenclature Code for Prokaryotes

We are revisiting the topic of systematics, focusing on SeqCode—a nomenclatural code specifically for prokaryotes identified through sequence data. This discussion features insights from Marike Palmer, a Postdoctoral researcher at the School of Life Sciences, University of Nevada Las Vegas, and Miguel Rodriguez, an Assistant Professor of Bioinformatics at the University of Innsbruck, affiliated with the Department of Microbiology and the Digital Science Center (DiSC).

## Overview of SeqCode

Marike Palmer explained that SeqCode was developed to offer a specific nomenclature for prokaryotes, especially those previously uncultivated. The key objective was to adapt the nomenclature system to include these organisms. Palmer emphasized that the SeqCode accommodates any peer-reviewed publication, with three designed paths for validation. The authors encourage collaboration with a curriculum team to ensure the quality of descriptions, naming, etymology, and establishment of stability in naming practices.

## Governance of SeqCode

Miguel Rodriguez described the governance of the SeqCode, which is already established and open to public participation. Its structure includes an executive board, committees, and working groups, with some committee members selected by ballot and others by cooptation.

The relation to the ISME Society was also clarified: ISME functions as an umbrella organization providing support for the SeqCode. This is not a competing code but a parallel system specifically catering to previously uncultivated organisms.

## Practical Requirements and Collaboration

Palmer and Rodriguez discussed the practical requirements for naming under the SeqCode, which involve specific standards for genome sequence data completeness and contamination levels. While the 16S rRNA gene sequence is not mandatory, its inclusion is recommended for enhanced accuracy. The conversation underscored the importance and challenges of naming microorganisms and the need for a system inclusive of both cultivated and uncultivated organisms.

## Challenges and Solutions

The discussion also touched upon using high-quality genomes as a foundational requirement for the nomenclature system. Obtaining complete genomes can be challenging, particularly for organisms like obligate intracellular parasites; thus, acquiring housekeeping genes might serve as an alternative strategy. Estimating completeness or contamination for many taxa remains a technical challenge, but these estimates are necessary for registering a name in the SeqCode registry.

## Conclusion

The creation of SeqCode has been a collaborative effort entailing diverse viewpoints and philosophies. It highlights not only the complexities involved in naming microorganisms but also the continuous endeavor among scientists to develop a practical, accurate, and universally beneficial naming system.

The episode emphasized the importance of scientific collaboration and the ongoing efforts to build a system that serves the entire microbial community efficiently.
