We've been busy attending in-person conferences such as **IMMEM XIII** and **ASM NGS**, so we thought we'd share some of our reflections with you. We discuss topics like waste water surveillance, hybrid conferences, and metadata, among other things.

#### 1. Waste Water Surveillance
Waste water surveillance is becoming an increasingly vital tool in monitoring public health. By analyzing waste water, researchers can detect and predict outbreaks of diseases, providing an early warning system that can be crucial in implementing timely interventions.

#### 2. Hybrid Conferences
As we transition back to in-person gatherings, hybrid conferences have emerged as a popular format. They offer the best of both worlds: in-person interaction with virtual accessibility, making conferences more inclusive and environmentally friendly.

#### 3. Metadata
Metadata plays a crucial role in organizing and making sense of the massive amounts of data generated in research. Effective metadata management ensures data is easily searchable, shareable, and usable in various scientific analyses.

The conferences provided valuable insights and illustrated the advancements and challenges within these areas of research. We look forward to integrating what we've learned into our future work.

### Key Points

#### 1. Career Development in Bioinformatics
- Transitioned from lab technician to bioinformatician through strategic career moves
- Emphasized the importance of contractor roles as entry points in scientific organizations
- Pursued academic training in bioinformatics while working at CDC

#### 2. Technical Learning and Infrastructure
- Recommends using Google Cloud VMs and VS Code for development environments
- Highlights the benefits of cloud-based workflows and version control
- Explores platform technologies like Terra.bio for bioinformatics pipelines

#### 3. International Public Health Collaboration
- Motivated by building global connections in public health
- Experienced international sequencing capacity development during COVID-19 response
- Values in-person interactions over virtual meetings

### Take-Home Messages
- Early career scientists should be flexible and open to diverse opportunities
- Technological infrastructure can significantly enhance research workflows
- Personal networking remains crucial in scientific collaboration
