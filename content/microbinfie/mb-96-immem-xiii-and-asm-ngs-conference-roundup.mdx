# Conference Reflections: IMMEM XIII and ASM NGS

We've been busy attending in-person conferences such as IMMEM XIII and ASM NGS. Here are some of our reflections on these events:

## Topics Discussed

### 1. Waste Water Surveillance
Waste water surveillance emerged as a significant topic of discussion. The potential of tracking public health trends through waste water analysis was explored extensively.

### 2. Hybrid Conferences
The shift towards hybrid conferences was evident. Attendees appreciated the flexibility and broader accessibility offered by virtual participation options alongside in-person attendance.

### 3. Importance of Metadata
Metadata and its crucial role in scientific research and analysis were highlighted. Properly managed metadata can enhance the quality and reproducibility of research findings.

These are just a few of the key takeaways from our recent conference experiences. We look forward to further exploring these topics as the field continues to evolve.

The guest speakers on the Microbial Bioinformatics podcast are Dr. Frank Ambrosio, who is a contractor with Theogen, discussing his experiences and insights in microbial bioinformatics.
