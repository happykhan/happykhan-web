In this episode of the Micro binfie Podcast, host Andrew Page sits
down with Tim Dallman at the 10th Bioinformatics Hackathon in
Bethesda, Maryland. Tim shares insights from his work at Utrecht
University in the Netherlands, where he focuses on genomic
surveillance and machine learning models to predict disease risk and
severity. 

They discuss the challenges of integrating genomic variation
into predictive models, the importance of high-quality metadata, and
the complexities of working with pathogens like Shiga toxin-producing
E. coli. Tim also talks about his role at the WHO Pandemic and
Epidemic Intelligence Hub and how global collaboration can drive
innovation in public health genomics. Tune in to hear about cutting-
edge research, the importance of interdisciplinary teamwork, and how
genomic data can be harnessed for future pandemic preparedness.

### Key Points

#### 1. Genomic Surveillance and Machine Learning
- Developing predictive models using pan-genome graphs
- Integrating genomic variation into machine learning approaches
- Focusing on Shiga toxin-producing E. coli as a research model

#### 2. Global Public Health Collaboration
- Working with WHO's Pandemic and Epidemic Intelligence Hub
- Creating networks to facilitate data sharing and innovation
- Addressing challenges in metadata collection and governance

#### 3. Interdisciplinary Research Approach
- Combining veterinary science with public health genomics
- Utilizing long-read sequencing for complex genome analysis
- Translating genomic data into actionable health predictions

### Take-Home Messages
- Machine learning can transform genomic surveillance strategies
- Collaborative networks are crucial for pandemic preparedness
- Comprehensive metadata is key to effective predictive modeling
