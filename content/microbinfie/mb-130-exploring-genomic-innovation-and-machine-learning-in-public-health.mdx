In this episode of the Micro binfie Podcast, host Andrew Page sits
down with Tim Dallman at the 10th Bioinformatics Hackathon in
Bethesda, Maryland. Tim shares insights from his work at Utrecht
University in the Netherlands, where he focuses on genomic
surveillance and machine learning models to predict disease risk and
severity. They discuss the challenges of integrating genomic variation
into predictive models, the importance of high-quality metadata, and
the complexities of working with pathogens like Shiga toxin-producing
E. coli. Tim also talks about his role at the WHO Pandemic and
Epidemic Intelligence Hub and how global collaboration can drive
innovation in public health genomics. Tune in to hear about cutting-
edge research, the importance of interdisciplinary teamwork, and how
genomic data can be harnessed for future pandemic preparedness.
