Host Andrew Page is joined by Robert Petit from the Wyoming Public
Health Laboratory. Robert, a key developer of the Bactopia pipeline,
shares insights into how this end-to-end tool is transforming
bacterial genomic surveillance. They dive into the origins of
Bactopia, its applications in public health, and Robert's experience
leading genomic projects in a rural setting. Discover how Bactopia
streamlines pathogen detection, improves documentation, and integrates
with other tools to deliver fast and accurate results.  Listen in as
they discuss new innovations in bioinformatics, including
visualizations and human-read filtering, and explore future projects
like CamelHUMP, designed to simplify sequence-based typing. Recorded
live at the Microbial Bioinformatics Hackathon in Bethesda, Maryland,
this episode brings you the latest in pathogen genomics and the
challenges and rewards of working on the frontier of public health.
