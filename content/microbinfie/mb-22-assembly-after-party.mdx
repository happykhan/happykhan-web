When you get an assembly, the fun doesn’t stop there. You then have to fix it up and see how good it is. In this episode, we discuss **scaffolding**, **gap filling**, **polishing**, **assembly metrics**, **quality control**, **genome structure**, and **visualization tools**.

### Tools and Papers Mentioned:
- [socru](https://github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/socru)
- [PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases Article](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004446)

In this context, **scaffolding** refers to the process of connecting genomic sequences into larger, more complete units. **Gap filling** addresses missing segments in these sequences. **Polishing** improves assembly accuracy by correcting errors.

**Assembly metrics** are used to evaluate the quality of the assembled genome. **Quality control** ensures that the genome assembly is accurate and reliable.

**Genome structure** refers to the arrangement of genes within the genome, and **visualization tools** help researchers interpret and analyze these data. 

For more comprehensive insights and detailed methodologies, please refer to the [socru tool](https://github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/socru) and the [PLoS article](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004446).
