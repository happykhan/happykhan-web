# Assembly Improvement: Beyond the Basics

When you get an assembly, the fun doesn’t stop there. You then have to fix it up and see how good it is. In this episode, we discuss:

- **Scaffolding**
- **Gap-filling**
- **Polishing**
- **Assembly Metrics**
- **Quality Control**
- **Genome Structure**
- **Visualization Tools**

## Tools and Papers Mentioned

- [Socru on GitHub](https://github.com/quadram-institute-bioscience/socru)
- [PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases Article](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0004446)

Each of these components is crucial for making sure your assembly is as good as it can be. Understanding the genome structure and utilizing effective tools can take your project to the next level.
