We’re continuing our series where we examine a particular microbial
species in some depth. We’re continuing our look at Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, focusing more on bioinformatics, genomics and typing.
Our guests are Dr. Suzie Hingley-Wilson Lecturer in Bacteriology at
the University of Surrey, Dr. Dany Beste Senior Lecturer in Microbial
Metabolism at the University of Surrey and Dr. Conor Meehan assistant
professor in molecular microbiology at the University of Bradford.
