# Exploring Mycobacterium Tuberculosis: Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Typing

We are continuing our series that delves deeply into specific microbial species. In this installment, we further explore Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with a focus on bioinformatics, genomics, and typing.

## Our Guests

- **Dr. Suzie Hingley-Wilson**  
  *Lecturer in Bacteriology at the University of Surrey*  
  Dr. Hingley-Wilson specializes in understanding the complex bacteriology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

- **Dr. Dany Beste**  
  *Senior Lecturer in Microbial Metabolism at the University of Surrey*  
  Dr. Beste’s expertise lies in the metabolic processes of microbes, contributing valuable insight into the behavior of M. tuberculosis.

- **Dr. Conor Meehan**  
  *Assistant Professor in Molecular Microbiology at the University of Bradford*  
  Dr. Meehan focuses on molecular microbiology, providing a deep understanding of the genetic and molecular makeup of M. tuberculosis.

## Focus Areas

1. **Bioinformatics**:  
   Examining the applications of bioinformatics in understanding M. tuberculosis.
  
2. **Genomics**:  
   Analyzing the genomic sequencing and data that reveal the evolutionary and pathogenic profile of M. tuberculosis.
  
3. **Typing**:  
   Understanding the methods used to type and classify M. tuberculosis strains, aiding in tracking and controlling outbreaks.

Join us as we dive deeper into these topics with insights from our esteemed guests.

The speakers on the MicroBinFeed podcast episode on microbial bioinformatics include Dr. Susie Hingley-Wilson, who is a lecturer in bacteriology at the University of Surrey; Dr. Jani Best, a senior lecturer in microbial metabolism at the University of Surrey; and Dr. Connor Meehan, an assistant professor in molecular microbiology at the University of Bradford.
