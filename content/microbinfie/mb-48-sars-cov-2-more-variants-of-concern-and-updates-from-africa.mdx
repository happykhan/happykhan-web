In episode 48 of the microbinfie podcast, the hosts discuss the rapidly evolving landscape of SARS-CoV-2 genomics, focusing on emerging variants and their implications for public health, with a special emphasis on developments in Africa.

In our discussion with Peter van Heusden, we explore the latest developments in SARS-CoV-2 genomics over the past two weeks. This includes an examination of the growing list of Variants of Concern and recent advancements in African regions. Below are some key papers and resources that were mentioned during our discussion:

### Key Points

#### 1. SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern
- Multiple new variants emerging, including B.1.525 (Nigeria), A.23.1 (Uganda), and C.2 (Zimbabwe)
- E484K spike mutation found in multiple lineages, raising concerns about vaccine efficacy
- Public Health England developing new thresholds for identifying low-quality variant cases

#### 2. Vaccine Challenges
- AstraZeneca vaccine showed reduced efficacy against B.1.351 variant in South Africa
- Limited trial data makes definitive conclusions difficult
- Concerns about variant impact on vaccine protection

#### 3. Genomic Surveillance Approaches
- Exploring low-coverage sequencing techniques for early variant detection
- Potential for using sewage and low-viral-load samples as early warning systems
- Ongoing debates about variant naming conventions

### Take-Home Messages
- SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity is rapidly expanding
- Flexible and sensitive sequencing approaches are crucial for tracking variants
- Continued research is needed to understand variant implications
