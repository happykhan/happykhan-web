We share short war stories about bioinformatics from the trenches of research. We share tales about a mystery massive Listeria outbreak, bubbles on flowcells, GAII woes, contaminated databases, the mass murderer, water pouring into a sequencing centre, changing protocols without validation, Excel issues and the ultimate complexity in science - Humans.

### Extra notes

- **Contamination Challenges:** 
  - There was a significant outbreak linked to *Listeria monocytogenes* contamination due to contaminated laboratory culture media, highlighting the need for vigilance beyond raw data acquisition.
  - An episode involving contamination of *Salmonella* detections due to genomic similarities with *Shigella* emphasizes the complexities in distinguishing closely related bacterial species in bioinformatics analyses.

- **Technological Artifacts:**
  - Issues with early sequencing technologies such as consistent adapter sequences causing sequencing errors were discussed. This underscores the importance of introducing complexity in samples to avoid such errors.
  - The "bubble controversy" with flow cells causing image distortions is an example of technical imperfections impacting data quality, which the manufacturer eventually addressed.

- **Data Verification and Trust:**
  - Common pitfalls such as over-reliance on database accuracy can lead to misidentifications, as seen in cases where bacterial data matched unrelated organisms due to errors in previous sequencing submissions.

- **Importance of Metadata:**
  - Highlighted was the catastrophic impact of mixing metadata, where a mis-sorted Excel sheet led to irreparably shuffled metadata, compromising the integrity of the genomic data set.

- **Human Error and Its Effects:**
  - Human errors, like an alteration in the experimental protocol without proper documentation, were discussed as a significant cause of data corruption or misinterpretation.
  - Suggestions were made for instituting positive control mechanisms to detect and mitigate such errors.

- **Tool Usage and Data Handling:**
  - Examples discussed the crucial role of using tools like *Kraken* correctly and emphasized thorough examination of genomic regions using integrated genome viewers (IGVs) to accurately diagnose and resolve data inconsistencies.

- **Lessons from Situations:**
  - Regularly auditing and verifying alignments and annotations during sequence analysis was recommended to avoid misleading conclusions, by ensuring sequence data corresponds correctly with classified organisms in databases.

- **Design Considerations:**
  - There was a cautionary note about building sequencing facilities on floodplains, learning from past damages to expensive sequencing equipment at the Sanger Institute.
