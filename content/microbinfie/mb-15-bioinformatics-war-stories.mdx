We share short war stories about bioinformatics from the trenches of
research. We share tales about a mystery massive Listeria outbreak,
bubbles on flowcells, GAII woes, contaminated databases, the mass
murderer, water pouring into a sequencing centre, changing protocols
without validation, Excel issues and the ultimate complexity in
science - Humans.
