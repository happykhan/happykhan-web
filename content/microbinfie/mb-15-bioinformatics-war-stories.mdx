# War Stories from the Bioinformatics Trenches

In the ever-evolving field of bioinformatics, researchers often find themselves embroiled in unexpected challenges. Here, we share some of the short war stories that exemplify the trials and tribulations faced in the trenches of research.

## The Mystery of the Massive *Listeria* Outbreak

A sudden outbreak led to a frantic scramble to trace the origins of *Listeria*. Unraveling the complex web of data was reminiscent of detective work, requiring an intricate puzzle of genetic information to be solved.

## Bubbles on Flowcells

Small but detrimental, bubbles on flowcells can cause significant disruptions in sequencing runs. These minute imperfections remind us of the delicate nature of our work and the precision required for successful data collection.

## GAII Woes

The Illumina Genome Analyzer II (GAII) brought its own set of challenges. From stalled runs to unexpected errors, navigating these technical hurdles often required creative problem-solving and perseverance.

## Contaminated Databases

The integrity of database information is vital. Discovering contamination can be a painful, labor-intensive process, requiring extensive cleaning and quality checks to maintain the reliability of critical datasets.

## The Mass Murderer

At times, data can yield unexpected insights into past events. One chilling story involves identifying a genetic link that unveiled the actions of a mass murderer, showcasing the unforeseen impact of bioinformatics on real-world events.

## Water Pouring into a Sequencing Centre

A sudden flood posed a threat to invaluable equipment and data. Quick thinking and swift action were necessary to mitigate damage, highlighting the vulnerability of high-tech facilities to environmental factors.

## Changing Protocols without Validation

Altering protocols without thorough validation can lead to disastrous outcomes. These cautionary tales serve as a reminder of the importance of rigorous testing before implementing any changes in methodology.

## Excel Issues

A familiar foe to many researchers, issues with Microsoft Excel can lead to significant data misinterpretation. From formatting errors to lost calculations, the frustration with this ubiquitous software is palpable.

## The Ultimate Complexity in Science - Humans

Beyond the equipment and data, the human element introduces the most intricate variable of all. Navigating personalities, communication, and collaboration often presents challenges as significant as the scientific questions themselves.

These stories, while varied, all serve to illustrate the unpredictable and often challenging world of bioinformatics. Each tale offers a valuable lesson in resilience, problem-solving, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.

### Extra notes

- **Contamination Challenges:** 
  - There was a significant outbreak linked to *Listeria monocytogenes* contamination due to contaminated laboratory culture media, highlighting the need for vigilance beyond raw data acquisition.
  - An episode involving contamination of *Salmonella* detections due to genomic similarities with *Shigella* emphasizes the complexities in distinguishing closely related bacterial species in bioinformatics analyses.

- **Technological Artifacts:**
  - Issues with early sequencing technologies such as consistent adapter sequences causing sequencing errors were discussed. This underscores the importance of introducing complexity in samples to avoid such errors.
  - The "bubble controversy" with flow cells causing image distortions is an example of technical imperfections impacting data quality, which the manufacturer eventually addressed.

- **Data Verification and Trust:**
  - Common pitfalls such as over-reliance on database accuracy can lead to misidentifications, as seen in cases where bacterial data matched unrelated organisms due to errors in previous sequencing submissions.

- **Importance of Metadata:**
  - Highlighted was the catastrophic impact of mixing metadata, where a mis-sorted Excel sheet led to irreparably shuffled metadata, compromising the integrity of the genomic data set.

- **Human Error and Its Effects:**
  - Human errors, like an alteration in the experimental protocol without proper documentation, were discussed as a significant cause of data corruption or misinterpretation.
  - Suggestions were made for instituting positive control mechanisms to detect and mitigate such errors.

- **Tool Usage and Data Handling:**
  - Examples discussed the crucial role of using tools like *Kraken* correctly and emphasized thorough examination of genomic regions using integrated genome viewers (IGVs) to accurately diagnose and resolve data inconsistencies.

- **Lessons from Situations:**
  - Regularly auditing and verifying alignments and annotations during sequence analysis was recommended to avoid misleading conclusions, by ensuring sequence data corresponds correctly with classified organisms in databases.

- **Design Considerations:**
  - There was a cautionary note about building sequencing facilities on floodplains, learning from past damages to expensive sequencing equipment at the Sanger Institute.
