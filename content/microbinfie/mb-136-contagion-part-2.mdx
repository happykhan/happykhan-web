In a two-part discussion, the hosts analyze the movie Contagion from
their expert perspectives, focusing on the film's portrayal of
epidemiology and genomics. They note that the movie compresses
timelines for dramatic effect, speeding up the virus's spread and the
response to it, and that decisions about managing a crisis are based
on societal values, not just science.  In part one, the hosts discuss
the movie's depiction of the R0 value. They note that while this
explanation is useful for the audience, it is unlikely that an
epidemiologist would need to explain this concept to other
epidemiologists. The group notes that the MEV1 virus is modeled on the
real-life Nipah virus and comment on a scene where the genome of the
virus is described as being 15 to 19 kilobases in length with 6 to 10
genes. They also discuss the movie's depiction of virus isolation and
the unrealistic speed with which the initial assessment of the virus
occurs. The podcasters touch upon the BSL4 lab and how the film
depicts how the scientists behave. They also discuss the character of
Matt Damon, who is exposed to the virus but does not get sick, and is
an example of an asymptomatic carrier.  In part two, the
bioinformaticians examine the "genome dashboard" scene, noting the
software's informative interface, which includes an alignment panel,
protein structure, and a recombination map. They also discuss a scene
where a phylogenetic tree is used to determine a change in the R0
value. They find this unrealistic because the tree is just a picture
that doesn't accurately represent how a virus spreads. The group
discusses how the bioinformatician is depicted in the film as moving
in and out of the lab, which may have been realistic in 2011 but is
less so in the present day. They discuss how the CDC is portrayed in
the film, noting scenes that were filmed at the actual CDC, as well as
their experiences at the CDC. The podcasters note the movie is very
US-centric and that many international partners would be involved in
solving a global pandemic.
