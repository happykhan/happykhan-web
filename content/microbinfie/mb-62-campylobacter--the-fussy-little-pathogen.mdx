# Podcast Guest: Dr. Ozan Gundogdu

Welcome to today's episode where we have the pleasure of hosting Dr. Ozan Gundogdu. He is here to provide us with a crash course on the foodborne pathogen **Campylobacter**. If you've ever experienced an upset stomach after consuming undercooked chicken, Campylobacter, often referred to as "Campy," might be the culprit.

## About Dr. Ozan Gundogdu

Dr. Gundogdu leads the Foodborne Enteric Pathogen group at the **London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)**. His team focuses on the study of physiology and pathogenesis of Campylobacter and other related enteric microorganisms such as **Listeria** and **Vibrio**.

### Background

- **Education**: Dr. Gundogdu completed his Ph.D. at LSHTM in 2011.
- **Fields of Expertise**: Molecular Biology and Computer Science.

For more information on Dr. Ozan Gundogdu’s work and research, you can visit his [profile on LSHTM's website](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/gundogdu.ozan).

We hope you find this discussion insightful and enlightening as we explore the world of foodborne pathogens with Dr. Ozan Gundogdu.

### Extra notes

- **Microbial Bioinformatics Focus**: Dr. Ozan Gongadou's work emphasizes the use of next-generation sequencing tools in studying pathogens like Campylobacter. This includes whole genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and metagenomics to explore microbial communities and interactions.

- **Challenges in Studying Campylobacter**: The pathogen is described as being difficult to study due to its specific environmental needs and non-model organism status. It poses challenges in laboratory settings as it is very particular and hard to grow.

- **Genomics and Genetic Regulation**: The compact genome of Campylobacter (approximately 1.64 megabases) contains open reading frames with minimal non-coding sequences, which suggests efficient genetic regulatory mechanisms that allow survival in less-than-ideal conditions.

- **Emergence of Genome Sequencing**: The first whole genome sequence of Campylobacter revealed unexpected characteristics such as lacking classical secretion systems (like the type three secretion system) but potentially having a type six secretion system in certain strains.

- **Microbial Community and Environmental Influence**: Research indicates that environmental parameters, such as stocking density, significantly impact the chicken gut microbiome and the prevalence of Campylobacter, suggesting the complex interplay between microbial communities and their environment.

- **Bioinformatics and Data Analysis**: The field of microbial bioinformatics is instrumental for understanding complex genetic structures and regulatory mechanisms in pathogens like Campylobacter, providing insights into disease transmission and control strategies.

- **Vaccine and Treatment Development**: Despite technological advances, the conversation around developing vaccines for Campylobacter remains complicated due to the cost-benefit analysis and challenges in significantly reducing bacterial populations in poultry.

The speakers of the MicroBinFeed podcast on microbial bioinformatics include the hosts Dr. Lee Katz from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Andrew Page and Dr. Nabil Ali Khan from the Quadram Institute in Norwich, UK. The guest speaker in the episode discussed is Dr. Ozan Gongadou, who leads the Foodborne Enteric Pathogen Group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
