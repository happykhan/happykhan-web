## Guest: Dr. Ozan Gundogdu

Today, we have the pleasure of hosting Dr. Ozan Gundogdu, who provides us with a crash course on the foodborne pathogen *Campylobacter*. If you've ever experienced stomach issues after consuming undercooked chicken, *Campylobacter* is likely the culprit. Dr. Gundogdu leads the Foodborne Enteric Pathogen Group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, where they focus on the physiology and pathogenesis of *Campylobacter* and other related enteric microorganisms, such as *Listeria* and *Vibrio*.

Dr. Gundogdu's academic background is in Molecular Biology and Computer Science. He completed his PhD at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) in 2011.

### Extra notes

- Dr. Ozan Gongadou, a specialist in microbiology and computer science, focuses on the study of the physiology and pathogenesis of *Campylobacter* and other enteric microorganisms using bioinformatics tools.

- Over recent years, research has shifted towards next-generation sequencing approaches, including whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and metagenomics.

- The compact genome of *Campylobacter* (*~1.64 Mb*), with efficient genetic regulatory mechanisms, presents a unique challenge in bioinformatics due to its survival in various environmental conditions despite being classified as microaerophilic.

- One of the first bacteria to have its genome sequenced (*1999-2000* at the Sanger Institute), revealing novel features like the absence of classic secretion systems (e.g., type III) and the presence of a type VI secretion system in some strains.

- Genome sequencing has revealed other unique features, such as O-link glycosylation and the existence of a capsule, previously unrecognized, contributing to immune evasion.

- Challenges in studying *Campylobacter* include its classification as a non-model organism, difficulty in cultivation, and lack of convenient animal models, which complicates experimental bioinformatics research.

- The bioinformatics research in *Campylobacter* requires integrating laboratory findings with applied research to understand its pathogenesis and environmental persistence, which remains inadequately explained.

- Researchers explore whether *Campylobacter* is a commensal organism, potentially affecting poultry health and microbiome dynamics.

- Current vaccine development efforts face challenges, including the organism's high prevalence and potential post-infectious neuropathy risks (e.g., Guillain-Barre Syndrome).

- Despite technological advances, there are ongoing efforts to understand transmission dynamics through different environments, such as poultry, wild birds, and water sources, all of which remain vital for controlling infections.

- A multi-faceted approach involving laboratory research, potential vaccines, policy intervention, and public education (e.g., proper chicken cooking practices) is advocated as part of addressing *Campylobacter* infections effectively.
