Prof. Mads Albertsen from Aalborg University shares insights into Denmark's rapid COVID-19 genomic sequencing efforts during the early pandemic, highlighting the national infrastructure and technological adaptations for viral genome tracking.

Denmark is one of the leading countries in the world for *SARS-CoV-2* genomic surveillance. Prof. Mads Albertsen discusses with us the intricacies of *SARS-CoV-2* sequencing in Denmark, covering its inception, logistics, adjusted protocols, and key lessons learned throughout the process.
