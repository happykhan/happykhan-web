# Scientists Transition from Twitter to Mastodon

Over the past few weeks, scientists have been shifting from Twitter to Mastodon. Our very own Nabil-Fareed Alikhan shares his experience with setting up and running a Mastodon server called [mstdn.science](https://mstdn.science), which has become a popular destination for scientists. We are also joined by Emma Hodcroft to provide an independent perspective on this transition.

## The Podcast

In the MicroBinfie podcast, Andrew and Nabil discuss the migration of academics from Twitter to Mastodon, highlighting Nabil's significant role in this shift. According to Nabil, Mastodon is a free and open web application designed for micro-blogging. Unlike Twitter, Mastodon allows integration and communication between servers, enabling users to follow, reply, or read content from other servers.

## The Reason for Migration

The migration began after Elon Musk purchased Twitter and implemented changes that raised concerns about freedom of speech and democracy. In response, Nabil and Duncan set up their own Mastodon instance at [mstdn.science](https://mstdn.science), initially intending to create a social network for bioinformaticians, microbial genomics experts, and tech-savvy microbiologists.

## Growth and Community

Initially expected to attract only 50-100 users, the instance quickly gained popularity, drawing in scientists, including Nobel Laureates, journals, and professionals from other disciplines. Nabil's instance now boasts almost 2,000 users. Other instances like genomic.social and ecoevo.social also experienced a surge in sign-ups.

## Resource Management

Nabil and Duncan's virtual server, which hosts nearly 2,000 users, costs around £100 per 1,000 users, depending on the level of interaction and activity. The Mastodon network replicates content from other instances, which generates many jobs even if a user's account remains unchanged. Nabil does not limit which Mastodon instances communicate with his site, but he does block domains that serve unwanted or unsafe content.

## Challenges and Advantages

While the Mastodon network faces challenges, including potential crashes, Nabil believes it could succeed in the long run. The podcast contributors suggest that some users, dissatisfied with Twitter's recent changes, find solace in Mastodon's decentralized social media platform. While some dodgy servers have been blocked for moderation, Mastodon has become a "sign" for users fed up with Twitter.

## Emma Hodcroft's Perspective

Emma, who recently moved from Twitter to Mastodon, views it as a hedge against Twitter's uncertain future. She appreciates Mastodon's decentralized platform, which shifts the power towards content and interaction—an advantage not available on a centrally controlled platform. While Mastodon may not serve as a direct one-for-one replacement for Twitter, it fits specific use cases, such as a space for academics to discuss research papers.

Emma argues that Mastodon's success is not reliant on Twitter's fate but rather on whether Twitter continues to implement "crazy ideas" in the future. While Mastodon may never be exactly like Twitter, it has the potential to be even better.
