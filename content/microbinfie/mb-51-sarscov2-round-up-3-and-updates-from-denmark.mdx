## Latest Developments in *SARS-CoV-2* Genomics

In the past two weeks, there have been significant developments in *SARS-CoV-2* genomics, as discussed with Mads Albertsen, particularly in Denmark. For the latest COVID statistics in Denmark, visit their [statistics page](https://www.covid19genomics.dk/statistics).

### Tools and Resources

- [Outbreak Info](https://outbreak.info/): A resource for gathering data about outbreaks.
- [Outbreak Info: *SARS-CoV-2* Mutation Situation Reports](https://virological.org/t/outbreak-info-sars-cov-2-mutation-situation-reports/629): Detailed reports on the mutation landscape.
- [GitLab Repository by Johan Bernal Morales](https://gitlab.com/johan.bernal.morales/sarscov2): Tools related to *SARS-CoV-2* research.

### Publications

- [A Comparison of Performance for Different *SARS-CoV-2* Sequencing Protocols](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.01.433428v1) examines the efficiency of various sequencing protocols.
- [Before the Surge: Molecular Evidence of *SARS-CoV-2* in New York City Prior to the First Report](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.08.21251303v1) provides insight into the early presence of the virus in NYC.
- [*SARS-CoV-2* Within-host Diversity and Transmission](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2021/03/09/science.abg0821): An article examining the genetic diversity of the virus within hosts and its implications for transmission.

### Additional Information

- For issues related to *SARS-CoV-2* sequencing data, see this [discussion](https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473).
- You can find masking information for *SARS-CoV-2* sites in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/W-L/ProblematicSites_SARS-CoV2/blob/master/subset_vcf/problematic_sites_sarsCov2.mask.vcf).

These resources and studies are crucial for understanding the genomic evolution of the virus and strategizing public health responses.
