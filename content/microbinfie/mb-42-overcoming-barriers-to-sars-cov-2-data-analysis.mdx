# Panel Discussion on Overcoming Barriers to SARS-CoV-2 Data Analysis

**Presented by:** ARTICnetwork & CLIMB-BIG-DATA

**Panelists:**
- Nick Loman, University of Birmingham
- Will Rowe, University of Birmingham
- Áine O'Toole, University of Edinburgh
- Andrew Page, Quadram Institute
- Anna Price, MRC CLIMB & Cardiff University

**Event Context:**  
This panel discussion was part of a workshop focused on COVID-19 data analysis. The workshop aimed to address the challenges and potential solutions in the field of SARS-CoV-2 data analysis.

## Topics Covered

- **Collecting Sample Metadata**: Discussing the importance of accurate and comprehensive metadata in genomic epidemiology.
- **Intrapatient Variability**: Exploring the genetic differences of the virus within a single host and its implications.
- **Building Bridges with Policy Makers**: Strategies to increase the adoption of sequencing in public health strategies.
- **Data Sharing**: The critical role of open data sharing for effective global genomic surveillance.
- **Improving Bioinformatics Skills**: Ways to enhance the bioinformatics capabilities of researchers and public health professionals.
- **Pipeline and Software Validation**: Ensuring the reliability and accuracy of bioinformatics tools.
- **Bioinformatics Reproducibility and Quality**: Best practices for maintaining high standards in research reproducibility.
