# GAMBIT: Accurate Classification of Bacteria and Eukaryotes

GAMBIT (Genomic Approximation Method for Bacterial Identification and Tracking) is software designed to accurately classify bacteria and eukaryotes using a targeted k-mer based approach. This methodology allows for rapid leveraging of whole genome sequencing of bacterial isolates, facilitating clinical identification.

## Key Resources

- **GAMBIT Software**: The software is available on GitHub at [GAMBIT Software](https://github.com/gambit-suite/gambit).
  
- **GAMBIT Suite**: Explore the complete suite of tools at [GAMBIT Suite](https://github.com/gambit-suite).

- **Research on GAMBIT**: For in-depth information, refer to the study published in PLOS ONE: [GAMBIT published research](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0277575).

## TheiaEuk: Fungal Genomic Characterization

TheiaEuk is another related tool that provides a species-agnostic bioinformatics workflow for fungal genomic characterization. This tool can be explored further through the article published in Frontiers in Public Health: [TheiaEuk Study](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1198213/full).

These resources and tools are essential for researchers seeking robust solutions for genomic classification and characterization in microbiology.

## Additional summary:

- **Gambit Overview**: Gambit is a tool for typing bacteria and eukaryotes. It uses k-mers (a known sequence prefix followed by a set number of bases) to build genomic signatures that define a species. This targeted approach contrasts with random subsampling methods like MASH.

- **Technical Implementation**: Gambit performs a targeted camera (k-mer) search, utilizing fixed prefixes with variable extensions to create genome-wide signatures, which can significantly refine species identification.

- **Accuracy and Validation**: The tool has been clinically validated to accurately call species, particularly useful in public health for confirming species with high precision. It provides a conservative approach, avoiding misclassification, crucial for managing genomic data in clinical settings.

- **Challenges in Bioinformatics**: Challenges include complexities in species differentiation, especially in closely related organisms like TB and bovis. Gambit's targeted approach is effective even in these edge cases.

- **Database Management**: Gambit leverages HDF5 format for data compression, storing k-mer integer representations for rapid data access. This system supports efficient, memory-conscious processing of vast genomic datasets.

- **Parallelization and Performance**: The tool is optimized for parallel processing, particularly in computationally intense tasks like database comparisons. This efficiency is crucial in handling and analyzing high-throughput genomic data.

- **Database Building**: The tool can build databases from RefSeq or custom collections, using standards like GTDB for improved accuracy over traditional NCBI taxonomy.

- **Applications and Tools Suite**: Apart from bacterial typing, Gambit has been used in cases like the Camtas Iris outbreak to type eukaryotes. The tool also supports pan-genomics and core genome analysis to define common k-mers across genomes.

- **Continuous Development**: Emphasizes the importance of ongoing software development and adaptation to maintain relevance and accuracy in microbial bioinformatics.

- **Accessibility**: Gambit and its suite are available on GitHub, providing access to databases and tools necessary for running its analysis, allowing researchers to try it with their genomic data.

These points provide insights into the microbial bioinformatics landscape, specifically how Gambit addresses species identification challenges with a targeted bioinformatics approach.
