We chat to Justin O'Grady, Andrew Page and Alison Mather about how
they went about sequencing 1500 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from one small
region in the UK (Norfolk), and how they went about using the data for
genomic epidemiology to help get a detailed, near real-time view of
the pandemic as it unfolded.  Some of the key points are that in
Norfolk and surrounding regions:  100 distinct UK lineages were
identified. 16 UK lineages found in key workers were not observed in
patients or in community care.  172 genomes from SARS-CoV-2 positive
samples sequenced per 100,000 population representing 42.6% of all
positive cases. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 1035 cases sequenced to a high
quality. Only 5 countries, out of 103, have sequenced more SARS-CoV-2
genomes than have been sequenced in Norfolk for this paper. Samples
covered the entire first wave, March to August 2020. Stable
evolutionary rate of 2 SNPs per month. D614G mutation is the dominant
genotype and associated with increased transmission. No evidence of
reinfection in 42 cases with longitudinal samples. WGS identified a
sublineage associated with care facilities. WGS ruled out nosocomial
outbreaks.  Rapid WGS confirmed the relatedness of cases from an
outbreak at a food processing facility.  The manuscript is available
