In a recent discussion, we spoke with Justin O'Grady, Andrew Page, and Alison Mather about their work on sequencing 1,500 *SARS-CoV-2* genomes from Norfolk, a small region in the UK. Their efforts contributed significantly to genomic epidemiology, providing a near real-time view of the COVID-19 pandemic as it unfolded. Here are some key insights from their findings:

- **Genomic Diversity**: Researchers identified 100 distinct UK lineages in the Norfolk area.
- **Lineage Distribution Among Key Workers**: Sixteen UK lineages were found in key workers but were not observed in patients or within community care settings.
- **Sequencing Intensity**: They sequenced 172 genomes from *SARS-CoV-2* positive samples per 100,000 population, representing 42.6% of all positive cases.
- **High-Quality Data**: A total of 1,035 *SARS-CoV-2* genomes were sequenced to a high standard of quality.
- **Global Context**: Remarkably, only five countries, out of 103, have sequenced more *SARS-CoV-2* genomes than Norfolk for this study.
- **Temporal Coverage**: The samples spanned the entire first wave of the pandemic, from March to August 2020.
- **Evolutionary Rate**: The study noted a stable evolutionary rate of 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per month.
- **D614G Mutation**: The D614G mutation emerged as the dominant genotype, which is associated with increased transmission rates.
- **Reinfection Evidence**: There was no evidence of reinfection in 42 cases with longitudinal samples.
- **Sublineage Identification**: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) identified a sublineage associated with care facilities.
- **Outbreak Analysis**: WGS effectively ruled out nosocomial (hospital-acquired) outbreaks and confirmed the relatedness of cases from an outbreak at a food processing facility.
