In this episode of the microbinfie podcast, the hosts discuss **Pathoplexus**, an innovative pathogen genomics database with a unique community-driven governance model and open-source approach.

Nabil and Lee bring a guest host Clint to talk with some of the people behind Pathoplexus http://pathoplexus.org/ 

### Key Points

#### 1. Database Governance
- Established as a Swiss 'Verein' (association) with community accountability
- Members can vote out executive board if unsatisfied with direction
- Designed to serve the pathogen genomics and public health community

#### 2. Open-Source and Transparency
- Everything is open-source and hosted on GitHub
- Users can raise issues, request features, and report sequence errors
- Encourages community participation and continuous improvement

#### 3. Data Sharing and Commercial Use
- Allows sequence uploads with flexible usage terms
- Acknowledges challenges of pathogen access and benefit sharing
- Aims to remain adaptable to future global solutions

### Take-Home Messages
- Community-driven databases can revolutionize scientific data sharing
- Transparent governance is crucial for scientific infrastructure
- Open-source platforms enable rapid iteration and community engagement
