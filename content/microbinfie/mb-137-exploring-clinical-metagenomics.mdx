In this episode of the Podcast, hosts Lee Katz and Andrew Page delve
into the intricacies of clinical metagenomics. Joined by experts
Torsten Seemann and Finlay Maguire, they explore the challenges and
methodologies involved in identifying pathogens in clinical samples
when traditional diagnostic methods fail. They discuss the types of
samples analyzed, the impact of low DNA concentrations, and the
complexities of sequencing data interpretation. The conversation
highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between
bioinformaticians and clinicians in managing difficult infections.
Despite the hurdles, clinical metagenomics is presented as a
complementary tool aiding in diagnosis, emphasizing the need for
genomic literacy among healthcare professionals.
