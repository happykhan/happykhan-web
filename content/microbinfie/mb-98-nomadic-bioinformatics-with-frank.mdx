In a recent episode of the *MicroBinfie* podcast, we had the pleasure of interviewing Frank Ambrosio, a bioinformatician working with Theiagen as a traveling bioinformatician. Join hosts Andrew, Nabil and Lee as they dive into Frank's journey from a lab technician and microbiologist to a role where he analyzes his data and pursues a master's in bioinformatics at Georgia Tech.

Frank shares insights from his tenure at the CDC, where he gained exposure to a variety of laboratories, including those focused on tuberculosis, biodefense research and development, surveillance-oriented production laboratories for *Streptococcus* genomes, and the division of HIV/AIDS prevention. For those aspiring to enter the field, Frank recommends applying through contracting agencies at the CDC to gain valuable experience and possibly secure full-time positions. He also suggests starting with a virtual machine and using cloud-based IDEs like Google Cloud and VS Code for their ease of use and reliability.

The conversation shifts to Frank's nomadic lifestyle as a bioinformatician, emphasizing his desire to connect with the global public health community. He recounts his experience of meeting collaborators in Mozambique, highlighting the significance of building personal connections for collaboration and support in public health.

Frank also discusses his approach to maintaining routines while traveling, utilizing Google Calendar for planning, and stresses the necessity of flexibility and adaptability. He praises the benefits of his digital nomadic lifestyle, enjoying enhanced flexibility, improved quality of life, and the capability to work from anywhere in the world. Yet, he acknowledges the challenges it poses, particularly for those who crave stability and predictability.

Host Nabil raises questions about mentoring and education for digital nomads. Frank candidly shares his positive experiences, noting the ability to maintain mentor relationships remotely and how collaborative projects strengthen mentor-mentee dynamics. The hosts conclude that flexibility has always been integral to bioinformatics, and technological advancements are facilitating global talent to contribute to missions of organizations like the CDC.

As for the future, Frank remains open to opportunities with Theiagen and the broader global bioinformatics community, optimistic about the opportunities that digital collaborations offer.

### Extra notes

- **Microbial Bioinformatics as a Career Path**: The conversation highlights the trajectories and choices made by professionals in microbial bioinformatics post their PhDs. The flexible nature of academic research, including the ability to collaborate internationally and work on meaningful projects, is emphasized.

- **Freedom in Academia**: It's noted that academia offers significant freedom and flexibility, allowing researchers to pursue interests without the constraints typically found in corporate environments, such as intellectual property (IP) protection. This enables open collaborations and the ability to track and study specific pathogens or microbial sequences.

- **Collaboration Opportunities**: A specific example discussed is the collaboration established during the COVID-19 pandemic for SARS-CoV-2 sequencing in Pakistan. This collaboration was facilitated by academic freedom and personal connections and led to significant contributions in identifying SARS-CoV-2 variants, influencing international travel policies.

- **Technical Methodologies**: Although not deeply technical in nature, the podcast briefly mentions the development and optimization of methods within the field. Challenges in developing these methods were overcome by teamwork and resilience, demonstrating the collaborative nature of research science.

- **Bioinformatics and Data Science**: It's suggested that individuals interested in higher earning potential should consider paths in bioinformatics and data science. These fields offer broader opportunities compared to more traditional lab routes that may be narrower in focus.

- **Sequencing and Variant Tracking**: The conversation details how genome sequencing was used to track and distinguish SARS-CoV-2 variants. The identification of different variants in Pakistan, such as distinguishing between Delta and Alpha variants, had significant implications for public health policies.

- **Role of Resilience and Encouragement**: Overcoming methodological challenges in research often depends on the resilience of the research team and the mutual support among team members.

- **Impact of Academia on Society**: The discourse emphasizes that academia enables impactful research focused on societal benefit. The discussion highlights the joy derived from contributing to scientific knowledge and public welfare, as opposed to industry, which may be primarily profit-driven.

- **Networking and Global Connections**: In academic settings, there is an opportunity to build a network of collaborators globally, which could potentially lead to travel and new research opportunities. This aspect of academia fosters a wider professional network compared to industry positions.
