# Interview with Frank Ambrosio: A Nomadic Journey in Bioinformatics

In this episode of the **MicroBinfie Podcast**, hosts Andrew Nabil and Lee interview Frank Ambrosio, a bioinformatician at Theiagen, as he embarks on a lifestyle of nomadic bioinformatics. Frank shares insights into his unique career path, experiences, and lifestyle. You can learn more about Frank through his [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francis-ambrosio/).

## Journey into Bioinformatics

Frank began his career as a lab technician and microbiologist before transitioning to bioinformatics. He pursued a master's program in bioinformatics at Georgia Tech to gain the skills needed to analyze his own data. During his time at the CDC, he broadened his exposure by working with various laboratories focusing on tuberculosis, biodefense research and development, surveillance-oriented production for strep genomes, and HIV/AIDS prevention.

### Tips for Aspiring Bioinformaticians

Frank offers valuable advice for emerging bioinformaticians:

- **Gain Experience through Contracting Agencies**: Start by applying for contracting positions at the CDC to gather practical experience, which may lead to full-time opportunities.
  
- **Utilize Technology**: Use a virtual machine and cloud-based IDEs like Google Cloud and VS Code for ease and reliability.

## Living as a Nomadic Bioinformatician

Frank discusses his experience as a traveling bioinformatician, sharing his passion for connecting with the global public health community. He recently met collaborators in Mozambique, highlighting the significance of building personal connections for effective collaboration and support.

He emphasizes the flexibility and adaptability required in this lifestyle. Frank leverages his Google calendar to manage his routines while traveling and revels in the ability to work from anywhere, appreciating his improved quality of life. 

However, he acknowledges the potential challenges, particularly for those who prefer more stability.

## Mentoring and Digital Nomadism

Nabil raises concerns about mentoring and education in the digital nomad world. Frank confidently shares his success in maintaining valuable mentor relationships remotely, often working collaboratively on projects that foster stronger mentor-mentee bonds.

## Technological Impact and Future Outlook

The conversation shifts to the role of technological advancements in facilitating global collaboration. Frank notes that these advancements make it easy to connect intelligent minds worldwide, aligning with missions of organizations like the CDC.

Reflecting on his future, Frank remains optimistic about the potential of digital collaborations. While he reserves the possibility of continuing with Theiagen, he is open to new opportunities to contribute to the global bioinformatics community.

In summary, Frank Ambrosio exemplifies the exciting possibilities of a digital nomad bioinformatician, balancing a flexible lifestyle with impactful contributions to public health and bioinformatics worldwide.
