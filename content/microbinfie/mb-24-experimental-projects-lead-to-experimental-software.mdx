Experimental projects often result in the creation of experimental software. In the realm of academic research, especially within bioinformatics, this software plays a crucial role. However, there are several challenges concerning its sustainability. Here, we delve into the current functioning of bioinformatics software, the reasons behind software obsolescence, associated quality issues, and potential strategies to ensure its longevity.

In academic bioinformatics, software is typically developed as a part of research projects. These tools are designed to address specific research questions and often remain experimental. They undergo rapid development cycles aligned with project timelines, which frequently means limited resources for long-term support and maintenance.

## Why Software Dies

Several factors contribute to the premature "death" of bioinformatics software:

1. **Funding and Resources**: Once a research project ends, so too often does the funding and manpower necessary to sustain its software components.
2. **Dependency on Individuals**: Many projects rely heavily on specific individuals who carry the expertise to develop and maintain the software. When these individuals move on, the software may be left unsupported.
3. **Integration Challenges**: Software developed for niche purposes might not easily integrate with broader systems or new technologies, leading to obsolescence.
4. **Documentation and Usability**: Poor documentation and complicated user interfaces can deter usage, reducing the incentive for continued support.

## Quality Issues

The rushed development cycles can sometimes lead to quality issues such as:

- **Lack of Testing**: Limited time for rigorous testing can result in software that is unstable or erroneous.
- **Inconsistency**: Different parts of the software might be developed by different people, leading to inconsistent code standards and practices.
- **Poor Documentation**: Insufficient documentation makes it difficult for new users to adopt the software or for developers to update it.

## Strategies for Sustainability

To enhance the sustainability of academic bioinformatics software, the following strategies can be effective:

1. **Community Engagement**: Building a community of users and developers can help share the load of maintaining and improving the software.
2. **Open Source Licensing**: Adopting open-source licenses can increase software visibility, attract contributions, and ensure continued development beyond the original team.
3. **Modular Design**: Employing a modular design approach allows individual components to be updated or replaced without overhauling the entire system.
4. **Institutional Support**: Encouraging universities and research institutions to provide support for the long-term maintenance of critical software tools can ensure their availability.
5. **Training and Workshops**: Offering training on software use and development can expand the pool of individuals capable of supporting the software.

By addressing these common challenges and implementing supportive structures, the sustainability of bioinformatics software can be greatly enhanced, ensuring that valuable tools continue to serve the scientific community effectively.

### Extra notes

* **Software Longevity Challenges**: The podcast highlights the short lifespan of bioinformatics software, often tied to the duration of grants or the tenure of developers like PhD students and postdocs. There is a lack of long-term maintenance which threatens the sustainability of useful tools. 

* **Funding and Maintenance Issues**: There is insufficient long-term funding for software maintenance, leading to projects being abandoned when key personnel leave. The discussion touches on how maintenance work is not typically seen as exciting and is thus less attractive in an academic setting.

* **Successful Software Projects**: Examples of successful long-standing bioinformatics tools include SamTools, Galaxy, BLAST, and FastQC. These successes are attributed to open-source community involvement, critical mass support, and consistent funding from multiple grants across different institutions.

* **Incentive Structures**: The incentive model in academia often focuses on novelty rather than sustainability, resulting in numerous similar tools being developed and quickly abandoned. There's discussion on how credit and recognition (e.g., through publication and authorship) can motivate sustained effort.

* **Re-inventing Wheel and Prototype Software**: Many software projects are likened to prototypes, often written as glorified scripts or hard-coded solutions only suitable for the developer's environment. The lack of modular and structured design makes it difficult for the broader community to adopt and extend the software.

* **Role of Community and Credit**: Giving credit to contributors, even if their contribution is minor, can encourage community support, thus enhancing the sustainability of software projects. The podcast suggests models for crediting developers in publication to foster collaboration.

* **Technical Migration Solutions**: One survival strategy mentioned for software projects is migrating older applications from desktop to web or mobile platforms, effectively rebranding them to attract new funding or users.

* **Funding Agencies**: Institutions like BBSRC are acknowledged for providing ongoing funding to significant bioinformatics software and databases, albeit the funding is very competitive and often oversubscribed.

* **Conclusion with Future Directions**: The discussion concludes with a note on addressing these challenges through improved strategies in software development and funding models that emphasize modularity in design and robustness in maintenance.

These key points outline various aspects of microbial bioinformatics discussed in the podcast, emphasizing technical, methodological, and systemic challenges that impact the sustainability and effectiveness of bioinformatics tools.
