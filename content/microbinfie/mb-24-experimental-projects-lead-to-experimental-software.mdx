# Sustainability of Academic Bioinformatics Software

Experimental projects frequently give rise to experimental software. This article examines the sustainability challenges associated with academic bioinformatics software. We will explore how the current system operates, the reasons software sometimes becomes obsolete, the quality issues involved, and strategies to ensure its continued viability.

## How Bioinformatics Software Currently Works

Academic bioinformatics software is often a byproduct of research projects. Typically, it is developed by researchers with a primary goal of addressing specific problem domains or hypotheses. The software is tailored to fit the needs of the experiment, which can lead to highly specialized tools. 

## Why Software Dies

1. **Funding Limitations**: Project-based funding often limits the duration of software maintenance, which can lead to a lack of updates and eventual obsolescence.

2. **Lack of Standardization**: Many tools are designed for specific datasets or experiments, making them difficult to adapt for broader applications or different environments.

3. **Developer Turnover**: Researchers, often being transient (e.g., students or postdocs), may move on without transferring knowledge or ensuring continuity in software development.

4. **Technological Obsolescence**: Rapid technological advancements can render tools outdated if they are not actively maintained or upgraded.

5. **Community Engagement**: Without an active user community, software risks not receiving the feedback and support necessary for growth and improvement.

## Quality Issues

- **Usability**: Academic software may lack user-friendly interfaces or comprehensive documentation, limiting its accessibility to non-expert users.
  
- **Reproducibility**: Without rigorous testing or standardization, results generated can be difficult to reproduce or validate.

- **Integration**: Compatibility with existing systems and workflows can be limited, posing challenges for integration.

## Strategies for Sustainability

1. **Securing Long-term Funding**: Establishing funding models that support ongoing maintenance and development rather than just initial creation.

2. **Developing Standards**: Collaborating to create standards for software development in bioinformatics to ensure compatibility and extend usability.

3. **Training and Documentation**: Providing thorough documentation and training for both developers and end-users to ensure knowledge transfer.

4. **Building Communities**: Fostering active user communities to drive feedback, collaboration, and collective maintenance efforts.

5. **Adopting Open Source Models**: Encouraging open-source development to leverage a broader network of contributors and maintainers.

By acknowledging these challenges and implementing targeted strategies, we can enhance the sustainability and impact of academic bioinformatics software. Through collaboration and innovation, the software can be kept alive and relevant, continuing to support scientific advancements.

### Extra notes

- **Sustainability in Bioinformatics Software**: The lifespan of bioinformatics software is often limited to the duration of the funding, typically around 3-5 years. This short-term focus results in maintenance challenges and discontinuation when key developers move on or when funding ends.

- **Maintenance and Support Issues**: Academic software development often lacks long-term maintenance plans. Even well-used tools require substantial effort to maintain for updates, bug fixes, and user support, which is often unfunded.

- **Successful Long-term Software Projects**: Examples of sustainable projects include SamTools, Blast, Galaxy, and others. These projects benefit from being open-source, having community engagement, and receiving ongoing funding and support from multiple institutions.

- **Academic Software Challenges**: Many tools are developed as prototypes and are not designed for sustainable use. They suffer from limited modularity and structure, making community contributions difficult. Also, they often result from academic exercises rather than practical solutions.

- **Credit and Incentives**: The incentive structure in academia drives software publication but not always its maintenance. Discussions suggest providing clear acknowledgment and authorship to all contributors as a way to foster community engagement and support.

- **Funding and Resource Allocation**: Problems include limited funding for software maintenance and an oversubscription to available funding calls for tool support. There's a need for dedicated resources for the staffing required to maintain critical software.

- **Community Support and Open Source**: Encouraging open-source models and community-driven projects are seen as potential solutions to increase sustainability, though challenges in coordination and shared credit need addressing.

- **Need for Improvement**: Efforts should focus on drawing a line between experimental and stable software, fostering modular design, and ensuring a clear path for software transitions post-graduation or career moves. There's potential for further discussions on strategic improvements in this area.
