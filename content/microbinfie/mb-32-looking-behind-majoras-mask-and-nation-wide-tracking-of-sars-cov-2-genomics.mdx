## Building Systems for SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Analysis 

Join Nick Loman, Sam Nicholls, and Radosław Popławski as they delve into the creation of systems designed to manage the analysis of hundreds of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes during a pandemic, notably without relying on Excel.

### Key Topics

- **Genomic Surveillance Challenges**: Understanding the unique challenges posed by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the necessity for robust genomic analysis systems.
- **Innovative Solutions**: Exploring how traditional tools like Excel are insufficient for such large-scale data analysis and the alternative solutions developed to address these limitations.
  
### Featured Research

- **MAJORA Preprint**: Learn about MAJORA, a system designed for continuous integration to support decentralized sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance.
  - Access the full preprint here: [Continuing integration supporting decentralized sequencing for SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.06.328328)

### Resources

- **COG-UK Consortium**: For more information on genomic surveillance and the efforts of the COG-UK Consortium, visit their official website: [cogconsortium.uk](https://www.cogconsortium.uk/)

This discussion provides insight into cutting-edge genomic research and the innovative approaches required to tackle pandemics effectively.
