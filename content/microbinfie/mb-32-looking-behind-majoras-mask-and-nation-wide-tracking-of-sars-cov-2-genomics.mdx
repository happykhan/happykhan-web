Join Nick Loman, Sam Nicholls, and Radosław Popławski as they discuss the development of systems to support the analysis of hundreds of thousands of *SARS-CoV-2* genomes during the pandemic, notably without the use of Excel.

Learn more about MAJORA, a system for continuous integration supporting decentralized sequencing for *SARS-CoV-2* genomic surveillance. You can access the preprint [here](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.06.328328).
For more information, visit the [COG-UK Consortium website](https://www.cogconsortium.uk/).

Here are the main points from the episode:

1. **Majora Database**:
   - Majora is the central database infrastructure supporting COG-UK's sequencing efforts.
   - It connects distributed sequencing hubs, integrating sequence data and sample metadata for analysis and public database uploads.

2. **Motivation for Majora**:
   - The need for an agile and flexible software solution arose from the sudden demand for rapid genome sequencing during the COVID-19 outbreak.
   - Existing systems were inadequate for the distributed nature and varied sequencing protocols of COG-UK.

3. **Development Timeline**:
   - The work on Majora began in March 2020, with a quick response to the urgent need for a user management system.
   - Initial prototypes were developed in a matter of days, showcasing the team's rapid adaptability.

4. **Technical Aspects**:
   - Majora is built on Django (Python framework) and employs Nextflow for pipeline management.
   - The design prioritizes flexibility and usability, accommodating a range of sequencing techniques and protocols.

5. **Integration and Testing**:
   - Majora's development involved collaboration with various stakeholders and was not built in isolation.
   - Testing was primarily integration-focused, with a separate test instance called "magenta" for deployment.

6. **API and Documentation**:
   - The API is a central component of Majora, with initial documentation created in Markdown.
   - Transitioned to a more structured documentation using OpenAPI specifications for better maintenance and usability.
   - A web interface developed by Anthony Underwood and his team enhances user interaction, allowing users to upload metadata efficiently.

7. **Community Contribution**:
   - The success of Majora relies on contributions from a large consortium of approximately 400-500 individuals across various institutions.
   - Collaboration and shared expertise were vital to the rapid establishment of the system.

8. **Cultural References**:
    - The name "Majora" is inspired by the video game "Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask," symbolizing its role in addressing the urgent global crisis.

Overall, the podcast highlights the collaborative effort and innovative approaches taken by the team to address the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic through effective bioinformatics solutions.
