# BACTOPIA: A Bioinformatics Workflow for Bacterial Genomes

We are again joined by Dr. Robert Petit from the Wyoming Public Health Laboratory, who is here to talk to us about **BACTOPIA**, a bioinformatics workflow specifically designed for bacterial genomes.

## Resources

- **Documentation**: [Bactopia Documentation](https://bactopia.github.io/)
- **Repository**: [GitHub - Bactopia](https://github.com/bactopia/bactopia/)
- **Publication**: [mSystems Journal - Bactopia](https://doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.00190-20)

Dr. Petit covers the key features and benefits of using Bactopia in genomic research, providing insights into how it can streamline bacterial genome analysis and improve research outcomes. For more detailed information, you can explore the documentation, access the repository for the workflow, and read the published study in the mSystems journal.

The speakers on the Microbial Bioinformatics podcast transcript include:

1. Dr. Lee Katz from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the University of Georgia, US.
2. Dr. Nabil Ali Khan from the Quadram Institute in Norwich, UK.
3. Dr. Andrew Page from the Quadram Institute in Norwich, UK.
4. Mark Pallon, a professor of microbial genomics at the University of East Anglia and a research group leader at the Quadram Institute of Bioscience.
5. Phil McGuire, soon to be an assistant professor at Dalhousie University in Canada.
6. Anthony Underwood from the Centre for Genomic Patterns and Surveillance.
7. Clement, a research scientist working in a hospital in Qatar.
