The MicroBinFee Podcast, a new podcast where we have conversations about
microbial bioinformatics. I am joined by my co-host Nabil Ali Khan and Andrew
Page, and I am Lee Katz. So what do the words micro and binfee mean? It's a
shorthand for microbial and bioinformatics. On the MicroBinFee Podcast, we will
have topics like the history of bacterial genotyping, how to write better
software, and what not to write. And we will have some guests. Yeah, everywhere
I go, people know me as the procker guy, and I'm okay with that. Having a paper
doesn't mean much if no one's cited it. So please subscribe to MicroBinFee on
iTunes or the podcast platform of your choice.
