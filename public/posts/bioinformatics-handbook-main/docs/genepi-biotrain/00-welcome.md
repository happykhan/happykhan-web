Welcome! This content was prepared as part of the GenEpi-BioTrain programme funded by ECDC. The GenEpi-BioTrain programme is an interdisciplinary course in genomic and epidemiology, which was held at Institut Pasteur between May 27th and June 7th, 2024.

The topic for this session is **Raw data and Assembly**

## Outline and Objectives

* Learn to handle raw sequence data, perform quality assessment using fastQC 
* Know about processing steps such as merging, error correction, and trimming to improve data quality
* How to read and interpret a QC report
* Explore assembly visualization, and methods for assessing assembly quality
* Gain insights into contamination detection
* Learn to recognize false SNPs and poor quality assemblies
* Understanding the impact of poor data quality on epidemiological inferences

* **Bioinformaticians** should master raw data quality assessment and processing, including tools like fastQC, to ensure precise genomic data analysis. They must also learn about genome assembly tools and techniques for comprehensive genomic analysis.
* **Microbiologists** must understand the impact of DNA library quality and sequencing quality for accurate data generation. They should use visualization tools to assess raw read quality and ensure accurate interpretation of genomic data.
* **Epidemiologists** must familiarize themselves with these concepts to ensure integration of high-quality NGS data with public health information. They should grasp how raw data or assembly quality influences genotyping data interpretation for effective surveillance.
